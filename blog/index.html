What exactly is a Mod Apk?



A mod apk is a modified version of an Android app that is distributed outside the Google Play store. People modify apps to add features not found in the original version of the app or game, while some do it to remove ads, change how the app behaves or get in-game resources.



People use different types of apps and programs to modify a regular apk and turn it into a mod apk with added or removed features.



Is a Mod Apk Safe to Use?



Most mod apks that you can download off the internet are safe to use, however in some cases there can be malicious apks that can harm your device.



However, if you are downloading the mod apk from a trusted place then you don't have to worry about it. If you are still hesitating about downloading and installing a mod apk then there is a website that you can use to check if the downloaded mod apk is safe to use or not.



How to Check if a Mod Apk is Safe to Use?



The easiest way to check if a downloaded file or a mod apk is safe to use is to scan it using virustotal.com, which is a website that can help you detect if a mod apk or a file contains any malicious code in them.



1. To check if a mod apk contains malicious code, go to https://virustotal.com/ on the device that you downloaded the mod apk.



2. Once the website loads click on the 'Choose File' button. This will ask you to choose the apk file that you want to scan using your phone's file manager.



3. After choosing the apk file the virustotal website will take a few seconds to min to scan the app and then will display the results of whether the app is safe to use or not.



Once the scan is complete, click on the summary tab to see if virustotal found any malicious code. If it says \"No security vendors and no sandboxes flagged this file as malicious\" then the mod apk is safe to use.



However, if it says \"1+ security vendors and sandboxes flagged this file as malicious\" then it's not safe.











Now that you know how you can check if a mod apk is safe or not lets see how we can download and install a mod apk.



How to Download a Mod Apk



To download a mod apk is very easy, it's like downloading anything else from the internet, all you need to do is look in the right places.



There are lots of websites that offer modified apks for you to download, just search on google for mod apk download sites then click the first link. On those websites, you can search for an app and download it.



You can also download mod apks from our website, the link is below 👇👇.



Download Mod Apks



To download a mod apk just click on the link above ☝☝ and search for the app you want to download and download its apk file.



How to Install a Mod Apk



Installing a mod apk is very easy, all you need to do is click on the mod apk file that you just downloaded and after that select how you want to install the app, on android it will say \"Package installer\", click on \"Just Once\" then the installation of the app will proceed.



After installing the mod apk it will show up on your phone homepage, from where you can open the app and enjoy the extra features that were added in the mod apk.",

				"articleBody": "Today I'll show you how you can Set up and use Cloudinary Image CDN in WordPress. The steps are very easy and simple to do and if you follow the steps properly then you will have Cloudinary Working and running on your website in just 5 mins.

Now for this tutorial i will be using the free tier of cloudinary which gives you 25Gb of Storage &amp; 25Gb of Bandwidth. Which is more than enough for a small blog that gets around 10000 visitors per month.



You get all the things like media optimization tools and image cdn in the free tier so no worries about limited resources. If you have a bigger website then you can upgrade to their paid plan, which is definitely worth it for the price.



What is Cloudinary Image CDN?
How Cloudinary Image CDN works is that it serves the cached images of your wordpress blog or websites through their fast servers located around the globe.

Whenever someone requests for an image from your website, cloudinary servers caches it so next time someone requests for the same image again then instead of your web hosting providing the image the cloudinary cdn servers will provide the image from the cdn servers.&nbsp;

This helps save tons of bandwidth for your website and also makes the loading of the images faster for all users around the globe despite your server location.


How to Setup &amp; Use Cloudinary Image CDN in WordPressWatch this video on YouTube
Creating a Cloudinary Account
Okay, so the first step will be to create a Cloudinary account. Now first you will need to go to the signup page of Cloudinary - https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free&nbsp;

In the Signup page enter your name, email, a secure password, select your country, enter your website name. After that in the product select “media optimizer and delivery”, Then click on create account.

												

Now Cloudinary will send you an email on the email given in the signup form to verify, so open your email and click on the “Sign In to Validate your Email Address”.

After you click on the link you will be on the setup page. Here first you will need to select your “Role”, you can select whatever you want like you can select web developer, Tech Executive Etc.



After that you will need to now enter your cloudinary cloud name, which is basically the name of the url that our website's content will be served from. Enter a unique name like your domain name or something else that you want. If it says name already taken then change the name.



Once done, select the server location. Which should be the closest region to your customers or visitors. Like if most of your visitors are from the USA then select the United States as the Cloud server. Click Finish when Done.
Configure Cloudinary
After you click on the Finish button, you will be redirected to the Dashboard of Cloudinary, Here click on the ‘Start Configuring’ button to start the Configuration process of Cloudinary Image CDN.

In the Configuration settings you will need to first enter a media source name. Enter any name like “cdn for my website’ or something. After that in Type select ‘Web Address’, scroll down.



Now in URL Base enter your Website URL. like ‘https://netmiko.com/’, if your website uses https then enter the https version of your url, if you don't use https then enter http version of your url.



Click on”Create Media Source” to Continue.

Now Cloudinary will ask you to update your Website media urls from your domain name to the domain provided by cloudinary. Now to do that you will need to open your website admin dashboard in another tab.


Install and Setup CDN Enabler


Now in the wordpress admin you will need to install a plugin called ‘CDN Enabler’ for changing your website’s media urls.

To do that first go to Plugins &gt; Add New, here in the search bar search for “CDN Enabler”, install and activate the plugin to continue. You can also download and upload the plugin from here - https://wordpress.org/plugins/cdn-enabler/.

Once the CDN Enabler plugin is installed and activated, go to its settings by going to “Settings &gt; CDN Enabler”.&nbsp;

In the CDN Enabler settings you will need to first enter the hostname, the host name is the domain name that cloudinary provided you with, go back to cloudinary configuration and copy the domain name you will need to add, after that paste it in the hostname.




NOTE: Only enter the domain name not url, like enter “example.com” not “http://example.com”.

After that below in the CDN Inclusions remove the default file extensions and enter these file extensions - .avif .gif .jpeg .jpg .mp3 .png .svg .webp (One per line)

In CDN Exclusions remove the default file extensions and enter these file extensions -&nbsp; .js .json .mp4 .pdf .apk .css (One per line).

Once done scroll down and click on ‘Save Changes’ and Not “Save Changes and Validate Configuration’. Once it's saved go back to your Cloudinary Configuration and click on Done to finish the Setup of Cloudinary Image CDN on Wordpress.


Test Cloudinary Image CDN
Now to test whether cloudinary is working on your website or not you will have to go to your website, here right click any image in your site. Click on “Open image in a New Tab”.

Now if the image is loading through cloudinary then you will have cloudinary.net in the domain name of the image url, if there is no cloudinary.net in the url and it's only your own domain name then it means cloudinary is not working.



Try to follow the steps again if that's the case. If it's working then it means your images are now loading through cloudinary and saving your website hosting bandwidth and cpu power.
Change Image Quality in Cloudinary CDN


Now by default the images that are served though cloudinary cdn are compressed to make it more optimized and make it load faster, now if you don't want Cloudinary to do that and just want Cloudinary to serve the original images from the cdn this is how you can do it.

Go login to your Cloudinary account, here go to the settings icon at the top bar, then go to the Delivery tab in the settings.

In the Delivery settings, select the quality of the images that you want Cloudinary to use from the drop down. Select ‘Best Quality’ then click on Save Changes. That's it, Cloudinary will now serve your website images at the original quality.



And that is how you can Add Cloudinary Image CDN to your wordpress website and set it up for faster images that load through cloudinary cdn. If you need any help then comment below, thank you.

				"url": "https://netmiko.com/hide-product-image-woocommerce/",
				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can hide the product images on the woo commerce products page.

With the help of this tutorial, you will be able to hide a single product image or all the product images on your woo-commerce products page. The steps to hide product images are very simple, it will take like 2 - 3 mins, so make sure to read this post to the end to prevent any errors.

Note: Before following the tutorial make sure to make a backup of your WordPress website just in case something goes wrong, although the steps are simple and don't interfere with WordPress core, still it's a good thing to take a backup.
Adding Custom CSS to hide Product Images
To hide the WooCommerce product image we will be using CSS code. Now to add a custom CSS code to our website we will first have to log in to the WordPress admin dashboard.

Now in the WordPress admin dashboard go to Appearance &gt;&nbsp; Customize. In the Customize menu, look for “Additional CSS”.



In the Additional CSS settings, you can add custom CSS codes.
Hide all product images in WooCommerce
If you want to hide all the product images from your woo-commerce products pages, then you can copy the CSS code from below and paste it in the Additional CSS box.
.woocommerce #content div.product .woocommerce-product-gallery {
display:none;
}
.woocommerce #content div.product div.summary {
float: left;
}
This code will hide every single product image from your products page in woocommerce. Now after adding this code if there is a “SALE” icon visible then you can copy and paste this css code to hide the sale icon.
.woocommerce div.product span.onsale {display: none;}

Once done, click on the Publish button at the top of your Customizer to save the changes.
Hide Single Product image in WooCommerce
If you don't want to hide all the product images from the products page and just want to hide a single product image then you can copy this CSS code instead of the other one shown above.
.woocommerce #content div#product-14 .woocommerce-product-gallery {
display:none;
}
.woocommerce #content div#product-14 div.summary {
float: left;
}
.woocommerce div#product-14 span.onsale {
display: none;
}

Here you will need to change the Product ID from “product-14” to whatever product id you want the image to be removed from. You can see the product ID of a product by going to “Products &gt; All Products”.

Just hover your mouse over the product that you want to hide the image of, this will display the ID of the Product. Note the id and change the id in the CSS code above from “product-14” to your product id.



Once done, click on the publish button to save the changes.

After hiding the product images from the products page, if there is a sale icon then you can remove it by using the CSS codes from below.
Hide the Sale Button in single product
.woocommerce div#product-14 span.onsale {
display: none;
}

Here change the product-14 to whatever your product iD is.
Hide the Sale Button in All products
.woocommerce div.product span.onsale {
display: none;
}

Remove Product image from a Product
This method is not recommended to use as after removing the image there will still be a placeholder of the image visible to users, which will look very bad.

If you still want to remove the product image from your products page in woocommerce instead of hiding it, then here's how you can do that. First Go to “Products &gt; All Products”.

Now using your mouse hover over the product that you want to remove the product image from, click on the edit option that will display when hovering over the product.



Now you will need to scroll down and look for “Product Image”, just click on the Remove Product Image option and scroll up and click on the blue “Update” button. That's it, the product image will be now removed from the specific product.



Now after publishing the changes if the images are still visible then you might need to clear the cache of your browser or website. If it still didn't work then you can comment below your website name and I will provide you with a custom CSS for your website.

That's it, that is how you can Hide Product Images in WooCommerce Product Page easily with a few easy steps.

The IndexNow plugin by Microsoft is a new protocol created to help webmasters to submit their website URLs to search engines that are using the INdexNow protocol. This plugin will help in notifying the search engines when there's any change in your website.

It will automatically notify the search engines of new posts, or deleted or updated posts. This will help in maintaining the SEO of your website or blog as the search engine will crawl, index your website better.
Install &amp; Activate IndexNow Plugin
You can install the Microsoft IndexNow plugin using two methods, you can either download it directly from the wordpress.org website or you can search it within your WordPress admin dashboard.

If you want to download it directly from the official website, here is the link for that - https://wordpress.org/plugins/indexnow/.&nbsp;

Just go to the link above and click on the download button, this will download an indexnow.zip file to your downloads folder. Once the download finishes go log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.



After logging in to the admin dashboard, go to plugins &gt; Add New, here at the top click on “Upload Plugins” then choose the file.

Select the downloaded indexnow zip file from your computer and click on Install Now. This might take a few seconds to complete, after it finishes installing click on Activate Plugin to activate the IndexNow plugin.



Now, if you don't want to go through all of the steps above then you can install the IndexNow plugin by just logging in to your admin dashboard.

Here go to Plugins &gt; Add New. In the search bar search for “IndexNow”, here now install the IndexNow Plugin by Microsoft. Once installed click on activate to activate the plugin.



The settings of the IndexNow plugin can be found in the left admin menu. Here just click on the IndexNow option.
Setup IndexNow Plugin
After installing and activating the plugin you will have to now set up the plugin to be able to use it.

If you click on the IndexNow plugin option from the admin menu the first time, then you will see the setup screen of the plugin. First, you will need to click on the “Let’s get Started” button.



Now you will be in the plugin dashboard, here if you want then you can keep the default setting of auto submission of blog posts when they update, publish, or get deleted. Or you can make it manual so that it will not automatically submit the URLs to the search engines.

If you want to change the submission of URLs in the IndexNow plugin from automatic to Manual then just click on the three dots at the “Automate URL submission” section and click on “Edit Preference”.



The Edit preference for Automate URL Submission will be enabled by default, all you will need to do is choose the Disable option and click on Save. Now your website URLs won't get submitted to search engines automatically.
How to use IndexNow Plugin
Using the IndexNow plugin is fairly easy, after installing and setting up the plugin you can let it automatically submit the URLs of your website when they update or get deleted or you can make it manual.

To manually submit a URL to the IndexNow plugin, first copy the URL of the post or page that you want to submit to the search engines.

After that go to the IndexNow plugin dashboard from the admin menu. Here in the Manual URL Submissions section, click on the submit URL option. Enter your URL and click on Submit URL to submit the URL to the search engines.



You can see the status of the URL whether it was submitted successfully or not below in the URLs submitted section.
When will the Submitted URL in IndexNow Plugin get Indexed?
Now after submitting the Url of your website's page or post to the IndexNow plugin you might be wondering when it will get indexed.

For your page or post to get indexed in the different search engines, your post or page must follow the different guidelines of the search engines. The IndexNow plugin only notifies the search engine that the submitted URL exists on the web so that the search engines can try to index it.

Submitting the Url to the IndexNow plugin doesn't mean that it will get Indexed. It only works as a tool to notify search engines about your URLs.
How to Uninstall IndexNow plugin Completely
If you don't want to use the IndexNow plugin anymore and want to get rid of all the data of the plugin then you can just deactivate and delete the plugin.

Deleting the IndexNow plugin will remove all the data associated with the plugin from your WordPress website.

That's it, that is how you can install, set up and use the IndexNow plugin By Microsoft to submit the Urls of your website for Indexing to different search engines like bing, yandex, google etc.

		In my case, I have moved the downloaded Koha zip file to the E: drive. So now after moving it, you will need to unzip the zip file. To do that select the Koha_for_Windows.zip and right-click it, click on “Extract Here”.This will extract all the contents of the zip file in your drive, this will take a little bit of time to finish extracting. After the extraction finishes the extracted folder that you will get will be named “usr”. 		
																														
			Running Koha Library Software 
		
		After extracting the zip file you will get an extracted folder named “usr”, now first make sure that the usr folder is directly in the root directory and not inside any folder, it should directly be in the root like “E:usr” and not “E:folderusr”.
Now to run Koha in your Windows operating system just go inside the “usr” folder, here scroll down and look for the “StartMysqlServer.bat '' file, double click on the bat file to run it.		
																														
		After double-clicking the StartMySqlserver.bat file, the terminal of your windows computer will run the file for a second and automatically stop and close the terminal.After running the first bat file, you will need to run the second bat file which will be named “StartServer.bat”, again double click it and let it run in the terminal, now to be able to use koha you will need to keep the bat file running in the terminal, so minimize the terminal tab.Finally, run the third bat file which is named “ZebraServer.bat”. Again keep the terminal window running, so minimize the window.		
			Access Koha Dashboard
		
		After running all the three bat files, you can now access the Koha Library Software dashboard by going to your localhost. 
In your browser just enter http://localhost:8080, this will redirect you to the login page of Koha Library, the default username and password for logging into Koha Windows version is “admin”. You can now start using Koha on your Windows computer. The version of koha that is provided here is Version 3.16.01.  		
			Access Koha WEB OPAC 
		
		To access the Web OPAC of Koha Library Software on windows you will need to go to http://localhost on your browser.		
			Stopping Koha		
		Once you are done and have finished your work, you can now stop Koha from running by first closing all the terminal windows that were running.After closing all the running terminal windows, go to your file manager and go inside the usr folder of Koha, here look for “StopMysqlServer.bat”, double click the bat file, and let it run, it will stop the Localhost server from running automatically.
That's it, Koha will be now completely stopped. To run Koha again on your windows just run the three bat files in the usr folder.		
			Uninstalling Koha from Windows
		
		To completely uninstall the Koha Windows version you will need to just delete the Koha usr folder from your computer. That’s it, that is how you can Install Koha Library Software on your windows operating system. If you have any questions or if you are facing any problem while installing koha, then comment below. Thank you.		
			FAQ - 		
			Is the Koha Library Windows version safe to use?
		
		The windows version of koha is safe, but I think it will be better if you could install the official version of koha on a Linux Machine Because in the Windows version of Koha you will not get a lot of security, and also you will not get any updates.It's better to just call a computer guy and install Linux on your computer. After that, you can follow this tutorial here - Install Koha Library Software on Ubuntu 20.04.",

				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can add exam results feature to a WordPress website for releasing exam results on your college or school's website.With the help of this tutorial, you will be able to add students' results at the backend of your college or schools WordPress website and then the student will be able to search the results at the frontend of the website using their roll no like this - 
																														
		You can manually enter the students' results in the backend or you can upload a CSV file to the WordPress site and upload all results at once. Okay now, let's see how we can do that.		
			Enable Construction Mode [OPTIONAL]		
		As we will be installing and adding a plugin and also entering data that is not supposed to be available to students before the results date, we will enable construction mode which will make your website unavailable to users until the release of the results.To begin you will need to first log in to your WordPress website, after logging in go to your WordPress website go to Plugins &gt; Add New. In the search bar search for “Under Construction”.
Install the “Under Construction” plugin by the developer WebFactory. Install the Plugin and activate it.		
																														
		After activating the plugin you can enable construction mode by going to Settings &gt; UnderConstruction. Go to the Main tab and enable Under Construction Mode, scroll down, and in Automatic End Date &amp; Time you can set a time when Construction mode will end.		
																														
		After setting up the settings click on Save Changes to enable Construction mode on your website. Now only the admins of the WordPress website will be able to access it until the time finishes.		
			Install Easy Student Result Plugin
		
		
The plugin that we are going to use for our WordPress website to add the feature of uploading students' results and searching the results by roll or registration no is called “Easy Student Result”.To Install the plugin first Log in to your WordPress website, then go to Plugins &gt; Add New.

			Edit the Robots.txt

		After editing the robots.txt file, clear the cache of your WordPress website if you are using a caching plugin.
			Adding Additional Features

Premium addons like CSV import results search by students name, Hiding students results from each other are some of the premium features of the plugin.NOTE: The plugin hasn't been updated in almost 2 years, which means that the plugin developer might or might not be still active, so be careful when purchasing any premium addon as if you get into any problem then there will be no one to help you.
