				"articleBody": "Today in this article we will learn how we can install and set up the SRA Toolkit in our ubuntu 20.04. I have given all the commands to install it step by step below.So, do read this article till the end so that you will not face any problem in installing the SRA Toolkit in your ubuntu 20.04.		
			Install SRA Toolkit in Ubuntu 20.04 -
		
		Now let's see how we can install sra toolkit in our Ubuntu 20.04. It will be easy and quick. 		
			Update -
		
		Before installing the SRA toolkit, we will first update our packages. We will use the below commands to update our packages.		
			sudo apt-get update		
		After we updated our packages, now let us see how we will install the SRA Toolkit.
			Create Local Directory -
		
		Before installing sra toolkit we have to create a local directory for this in our ubuntu system. To create a local directory, we will use the command given below, where you can create a directory of any name in place of “yourdirectoryname”.		
			mkdir -p yourdirectoryname/local
		
		Now that we have created a directory, now we will have to change our working directory. We will use the command given below for this, which will change our current working directory to the one that we made.		
			cd yourdirectoryname
		
			Download SRA Toolkit -
		
		Now you will have to download the sra toolkit inside this directory. We will download tar.gz of sra toolkit for this. To download this tar file copy the below commands and paste it in your terminal and press enter.
			wget --output-document sratoolkit.tar.gz https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-ubuntu64.tar.gz
		
			Check and Extract SRA Toolkit -
		
		Now we will check whether our sra toolkit has been downloaded or not in our directory. To check that we have to type the following command in the terminal while our working directory is “ yourdirectoryname”. You can also manually open your file manager and go to the \"yourdirectoryname\" folder where you can see the downloaded tar file.		
			ls 		
		After typing the above command, if you see sratoolkit.tar.gz in terminal then it means that sra toolkit has been downloaded which we have to extract now.To extract, we will use the below command which will extract the sra toolkit in the same directory.
			tar -vxzf sratoolkit.tar.gz		
			Append binary path to path environment variable - 		
		Now we will have to append the path of our binary to the path environment variable. To append it we will copy the below command and then paste it in our terminal.		
			export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/sratoolkit.2.11.1-ubuntu64/bin
		
		Here in this command if your system is 32-bit then you have to write ubuntu32 instead of ubuntu 64 and also sratoolkit version will be different due to updates. So make sure you use the correct version name in this command. You can see what version you downloaded in your terminal when downloading the tar file.After entering the above command, now we have to check whether our system can find this binary or not. To see that we will type the command given below.
			which fastq-dump
		
		After typing this above command, if you see “ /yourdirectoryname/local/sratoolkit.2.11.1-ubuntu64/bin/fastq-dump” in your terminal it means that our system can find the binary.		
			SRA Toolkit Configuration - 		
		Now we have to configure our sra toolkit. To configure the sra toolkit, first of all type the following command in the terminal after which the configuration panel of the sra toolkit will open from where we can complete the final steps.		
			vdb-config -i
		
		After entering the command you will get the configuration panel of sra toolkit where the red color mark on the side of the first option means that you have just selected that option and to change that you have to press “TAB KEY” in your computer keyboard.You can choose other options using tab key and enter key. 
Keep pressing TAB KEY until your red mark appears at the side of CACHE. When your red mark is at the side of the CACHE option then you have to press ENTER KEY.After you hit enter and get inside the CACHE option here you will have to press TAB KEY again and then select the choose button below the location of user-repository option.Now after we have selected the choose option here we will have to select the directory that we created at the beginning of the tutorial, which in our case is yourdirectoryname. Enter the directory by selecting it with the help of the arrow key on our keyboard and then select the folder named local and press enter.
After this, again with the help of TAB KEY, go to the option of OK and press it and then select the option yes and present enter.Now we have to click on save option here and then click on ok. After this we have to go to the exit button and then press enter.

				"articleBody": "Today we will see how we can install docker in our ubuntu 20.04 and on our windows 10 computer. This installation process will be very easy and anyone can follow it to install docker easily. So let's now see how we can install docker.First of all i will show you how to install docker in ubuntu 20.04 after that we will see how to install it in windows 10 if you want to install in windows then scroll down or select windows from the table of contents.
			Install docker on ubuntu 20.04 -
		
		Before installing Docker in our Ubuntu system, we have to setup a docker repository after which we will install docker in it.		
			Setup Docker Repository -
		
		Update System - To install Docker in ubuntu, first we will update our Ubuntu packages i.e. update its apt packages, for which we will use the command given below -		
			sudo apt-get update		
		Install important packages -Now we will install some such packages in our ubuntu system which will allow apt to use a repository with https. Packages that we are going to install is - apt-transport-https which will allow us to access repository via https, ca-certificate, curl which we need for data transfer from any server, gnupg-agent , software-properties-common. To install all these packages, we will use the commands given below.
			sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https -y
		
			sudo apt-get install ca-certificates -y
		
			sudo apt-get install curl -y		
			sudo apt-get install gnupg-agent -y
		
			sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
		
		Add gpg key -Now we will add the gpg key to it, which we use to sign files and check their signature.To install the GPG key, we will  type the following command in our terminal which is -		
			curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
		
		After typing the above command, GPG key will be installed in your ubuntu and it will show OK in your terminal, if OK does not show then check your command whether it is correct or not. you might have pasted the command wrong.To check whether our GPG key is installed or not, we can use the command given below to verify it.
			sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
		
		When we type this command in terminal, the terminal will show us the fingerprint of our GPG key which means that GPG key is now installed in our ubuntu system.Add Repo to Apt -Now we will add our repository to apt for which we will use the command given below.		
			sudo add-apt-repository &ldquo;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable&rdquo;		
		In this command we have written stable because we want to install only the stable version of docker for which we have added the stable repository. You can also install different versions of docker, but I recommend the stable version only.In place of [arch=amd64] you will need to write the architecture of your system, which can be different in everyone's system, remove amd64 and give the architecture of your system. To know the architecture of your system, you have to go to System monitor where you can see your architecture in the system option, this will show you what architecture your device is made up of.
			Install Docker - 		
		Now we will see the process of installing Docker-engine, for which we will first update the apt packages of our system again.		
			sudo apt-get update
		
		After this we will install docker and also along with docker we will also install its cli and containerd.io.		
			sudo apt-get install docker-ce -y		
			sudo apt-get install docker-ce-cli -y		
			sudo apt-get install containerd.io -y
		
		Docker is now successfully installed in our system, to check that you can type some of the commands given below.Which are used to check the version of docker and to check if docker can run a container or not.
\" docker --version \" This command will show you the version of docker which version of docker is installed in your system. If it says \" command not found \" then it means that docker is not installed in your system.By typing this command “sudo docker run hello-world” if you see “Hello from docker” in terminal then it means that docker is working properly and can run a container.

			Install Docker on Windows 10 - 
		
																														
		Now let us see how to install docker in windows 10 which is very easy. So let us now see the process of installing docker in windows.
To install docker, first we have to download docker exe file which we will find in docker official website - “https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop” go to this link and then Click on Download for windows, after which the exe file of docker will be downloaded in your computer.		
			Enable Hyper-V Feature -
		
		Before installing Docker in windows, we have to enable Hyper-V feature of windows which we need to run and install docker.Enable Virtualization - Before enabling Hyper-V, we have to see whether Virtualization is enabled in our windows computer or not, for which we will open our task manager and there we will go to performance where we will see Virtualization  at the bottom of the right side. If it is disabled then you have to enable it now, for which you follow the steps given below.
To enable virtualization, you have to first click on the windows logo and then click on settings. By going to the settings, we will get updates and security.Here we will go to the recovery option, here we will click on the option of restart which is under the advanced startup, after you click that, the computer will restart.Now we will get some options on our screen in which we have to select troubleshoot option and then we have to select advanced options. Now we will get many options here out of which we have to click on \"UEFI Firmware settings\" and then we have to click on restart button.Here now we have to select the bios setup for which we will use our function keys because here you cannot use the mouse. After selecting it with the help of function keys, press enter.
Now we will click on system configuration here after which we will go to Virtualization technology and press enter. Now we will go down with the help of our arrow keys and select Enabled instead of Disabled. After this we will select save and exit with the help of our function keys and after that our system will automatically restart normally.After restarting we will have to check whether virtualization is now enabled or not, you can open your task manager where you will have to go to performance where you will get the option of virtualization and there you will need to see whether it is enabled or disabled.Enable Hyper-VAfter virtualization is enabled, to enable Hyper-V, we will first have to search Hyper-V in the search bar of windows and then open the windows features. Now here we have to select Hyper-V and then click on OK, after that Hyper-V will be installed in it, after which we will have to restart our computer again.
Hyper-V is not available in all windows computers only in professional, education and pro versions.After restarting, we will have to go to the search bar again and search for Hyper-V there. Now we will open it, after opening we have to click on the virtual switch manager in the right side and then there we will have to select the new virtual network.Here we will choose the external option and then click on create virtual switch and then we will click on OK after which Hyper-V is now enabled completely.If you are facing any problem in enabling Hyper-V then you can search on YouTube how we can install Hyper-V in windows 10 and you will get many videos with the help of which you can easily install it on your windows 10 and can enable Hyper-V in the computer.
Install Docker on windows -Now that we have enabled Hyper-V, now we can install our docker, we will run the exe file we downloaded to install it and then we will come to the setup wizard of docker. Where we have to click on OK, after which our docker installation will start.It will take some time to install, after which docker will be installed in your Windows 10.Once installed, you will have to restart your windows computer once. After restarting, you can now search docker in your search bar.
To know whether docker is installed or not, you have to open your command prompt where you have to type \"docker --version\" which will show you the version of docker which means that docker has been installed.And just like in ubuntu, to see if its container is working properly or not you have to type hello world command \"docker run hello-world\" which will pull  hello world image from docker library which means your container is working fine. This means that docker is now installed in your Windows 10 and is working properly.		
			Frequently asked questions -		
			Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock error while installing docker in ubuntu.		
		
If you are also getting this error while installing docker, then it means that some process is running in your system which you have to stop first so that you can proceed.It is very easy to fix this error. When your terminal shows you this error, along with it it also shows an ID which you need to fix this problem.You get an ID which is something like “It is held by process 0000” Here our ID is 0000 which is different for everyone.To fix this error, we will use the command given below, where at the end we will enter our ID which we want to stop.
			sudo kill 0000		
		After typing this command that process will stop and then you can proceed with your docker installation process.		
			Where is Docker easier to install? Ubuntu or Windows -
		
		It is easier to install Docker in ubuntu as compared to windows because in windows you have to enable many such settings which are not easy for non-technical person. Due to which many people do not prefer to install docker in windows.If you talk about ubuntu, it is very easy to install docker in it, you just have to type some commands in terminal which will install docker in your ubuntu 20.04.
			Can we install docker on different versions of ubuntu using this tutorial?		
		Yes, you can install docker in different versions of ubuntu also with the help of this tutorial because if you are using different version of ubuntu then the steps are same and you will not have any problem in installing it.If you liked this tutorial, then definitely share it with your friends who want to install docker on their ubuntu linux and windows 10.

				"articleBody": "Today we will see how we can install WordPress in Ubuntu. And also setup all the things. This tutorial will be very easy and with the help of this you can easily install WordPress in your ubuntu.First of all we will setup a LAMP server after which we will install WordPress in it. For this tutorial we have used ubuntu 20.04 LTS. If you want to install your WordPress in your localhost i.e. in XAMPP then click on this link - Install WordPress in xampp Here I showed in detail how you can run WordPress by installing it in xampp.		
			Update 		
		First of all we will update the index packages for which we will use this command which will update it.		
			sudo apt update		
			Install NGINX 		
		After the update is complete, now we will install nginx which is an open source web server in which we will install WordPress later. To install nginx, you have to type the command given below.		
			sudo apt install nginx -y
		
		It will take some time to install, it depends on your internet connection how long it will take to install it. After nginx is installed, you can type the command given below to check its status.		
			sudo systemctl status nginx		
		By typing this command you will see the status of nginx in terminal whether it is working or not. You can also check this by going to your web browser whether nginx is installed or not, for this you will need the IP address of your server, to get which you can use the command given below.		
			ip a		
		Enter this ip address in your browser and if the landing page of nginx appears in your browser it means it is well installed and working.		
			Install MySQL Database 		
		Now we will install MySQL database in this server which is a very important component to run WordPress. To install it, we will type the command given below.		
			sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client -y		
		We are installing MySQL client because we need MySQL client to connect to our database. It will take you 2 - 5 minutes to install MySQL, it depends on your internet speed.After MySQL is installed, we have to start it, to start you have to type this command -		
			sudo systemctl start mysql		
			Enable MySQL and NGINX 		
		Now we will enable MySQL and nginx. By enabling this, if you ever reboot your system, then MySQL and nginx will start automatically, which if you do not enable then you have to start them manually. To enable MySQL and nginx, type this command -		
			sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl enable nginx
		
			Configure MySQL Database 		
		Now we will deploy our MySQL server for which we will type the below command so that it will be deployed securely.		
			sudo mysql_secure_installation		
		After typing this command, it will ask you to set a password, for which you will first have to select \"y\" then you will have to select number 2, after which you can enter any good password of your choice in it.After this, you will have to select \" y \" in all the options that come after which your MySQL server will be deployed.		
			Connect to MySQL database 
		
		After the MySQL server is deployed, now we have to connect to it with the role of a root user. For which we will type the command given below so that we can connect to the database with the role of a root user.		
			sudo mysql -u root -p		
		Now it will ask you for your database password which you set during database configuration. After typing the password we will be logged in to our MySQL server after which we will have to create a database in it.		
			create database wordpress;		
		And you will also have to create a user.		
			create user &ldquo;yourusername&rdquo;@&rdquo;localhost&rdquo; identified by &ldquo;yourpassword&rdquo;; 		
		Keep in mind that your password must be good, it must be strong, it must contain a capital letter, small letter, a symbol and number.Now we will give all those privileges of this database to our user for which we will use this command.		
			grant all privileges on wordpress.* to &lsquo;yourusername&rsquo;@&rsquo;yourpassword&rsquo;;		
			flush privileges;
		
			exit;		
			Install PHP 
		
		Now we will install PHP in our web server because this is something that we need to install and run WordPress in an ubuntu web server. Type this command to install PHP.		
			sudo apt install php7.4 php7.4-gd php7.4-mysql php7.4-zip php7.4-fpm -y
		
		Now all the requirements are downloaded and this means that our LAMP server is also ready to install WordPress. So let us now see how we can install WordPress in ubuntu.		
			Install WordPress in Ubuntu 
		
		Now we will install WordPress in our ubuntu for which we will copy this link \"https://wordpress.org/latest.zip\" and after that we will type this command in the terminal of our server so that latest WordPress version will be installed in our web server.		
			sudo apt install wget
		
			wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip		
		Now we have to unzip the downloaded WordPress zip file, for which we will first install unzip, for which we will use this command.		
			sudo apt install unzip -y		
		Unzip will now be installed in our system. After this we will unzip the zip file of WordPress.		
			ls		
			unzip latest.zip
		
		After WordPress is unzipped, a new folder will now appear in your directory, which will be named WordPress. Now change your working directory to WordPress.		
			cd wordpress/
		
			ls		
		Now we will copy all the files in this folder to /var/www/html/ for which we will use this command.		
			sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
		
		After this we will change the permissions of this folder which we need to install any plugins or anything in WordPress.		
			sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/		
		After this we will restart our nginx server -		
			sudo systemctl restart nginx		
			Configure WordPress 		
		Now we have to do some configuration in the default files of WordPress. For this, first we will change our directory and go to the directory given below.		
			cd  /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/		
			ls		
		Now we will move the default file that is in it to WordPress by default. For which we will type this command.		
			sudo mv default wordpress		
		Now we will edit this WordPress file for which we will use Nano editor.		
			sudo nano wordpress
		
		Here you will have to edit some lines, whose image is below, which you will have to change.		
																														
		We'll go down a bit after that and uncomment these things there because we're using PHP.		
																														
		After all the editing is complete, we will hit exit from our Nano editor, save it and then type the command given below.		
			sudo nginx -t 		
		With the help of the above comment, it happens that it checks the syntax of the file we just saved, whether it is right or wrong. After the check is successful, we will now restart our nginx server.		
			sudo systemctl restart nginx
		
		WordPress is now installed in our ubuntu server and you can now do the rest of the configuration in it by going to your chrome browser. For this, you have to type your server IP address in your browser and then it will redirect you to WordPress configuration.		
			ip a		
			Final WordPress Configuration 
		
		After typing the IP address in the browser, when the configuration page will open, we will have to select your language here and then click on continue. After clicking on continue, we will have to type the user name of the database in this and the password of the database and then we will have to click on submit.After that we will click on run the installation. After this we will have to give a name to our website and to log in to the website, we will have to give a username and a password and the email address you have so that if you ever forget the password, you can reset it.And finally we will click on Install WordPress which will install our WordPress completely. Now you can login to your WordPress site from its admin panel. If you want to install SSL in your website then you can also see this post \"Install SSL certificate in ubuntu\" here You will get complete details of installing ssl in ubuntu.		
			Install Theme in WordPress 
		
		Now we will see how we can install a theme in WordPress so that the look of your website looks very good.To install the theme, you must first login to your WordPress admin dashboard through your username and password that you gave during installation.After login to the dashboard, you will get the option of appearance below on the left side, above which if you hover your mouse, then you will get the option of themes, on which you will have to click. Here you will get the add new option on which you have to click.Here now you can install it by hovering over any theme, on hovering over any theme, you will see the option of install, which you have to click, after clicking it, it will be installed. After installation, you will get an activate button, which you have to click, so that the theme will now be activated on your website.If you have already purchased a theme and want to install it, then you will first have to go to the appearance and then to the themes where you have to click on the button of add new, there you will get the option of upload theme. But you have to click.Now you have to select your theme which is in your computer by clicking on the option of choose file and then click on the option of install now, now it will have to be uploaded and after uploading you will have to activate it and by which it will be activated in your website.		
			Install Plugin in WordPress 		
		If you want to install a plugin, then you have to first go to the option of plugins from the menu then click on the add new option there, after clicking on add new you can search for any plugin and install it.If you have purchased and downloaded a plugin, then you can activate it by uploading it by clicking on the upload button and in the same way you can install both the theme and the plugins.		
			Conclusion - 		
		And just like that you can easily install WordPress on your ubuntu server and create a website. If you have to install SSL certificate in your website then I have given its link in the article. Click on it and if you want to host the WordPress site on your localhost, then I have also given its link.If you liked this post, then do share it with your friends and do comment below.

				"url": "https://netmiko.com/install-ssl-certificate-in-ubuntu/",
				"articleBody": "Today I'll walk you through the steps to Install an SSL certificate in our ubuntu server. By which we can use HTTPS connection in our server which is a secure connection.The web server we are going to use in this tutorial is installed on Amazon EC2 and in this we have used Ubuntu 20.04.Now let us see how we can install SSL in our Ubuntu web server step by step. For this, first we will create an instance in our Amazon AWS console in which we will install ubuntu 20.04 .		
			Create a New Ubuntu Server		
																														
		1. To create a new ubuntu server we will first go to EC2 Management Console of amazon aws and click on Launch Instance button there. After that, we have to select a Machine Image where we will select Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and click on Next.2. Now we will select t2.micro for Instance Type because we are making this server in free tier of amazon aws. If you want to select any other then you can do that but keep in mind that you can Afford the one you want to select. After that we will click on Next - configure instance details.3. In Configure instance details we will not change anything, just 2 things we have to change is iam role where we have to select a role. To create a new role, click on Create new role on the side. After that we have to select Enable termination protection after which we will click on Next - add storage.4. We will allow the storage to remain 8GB, after which we will click on Next - Add Tags.5. Here we will type \"project\" in key option and in value we will type \"ssl-ubuntu\" and then after that we will click on next - configure security group in it.6. In the security group, we will give the security group name \"web-server\". After that we will click on the Add rule button below and there we will select \"HTTP\" make Source Anywhere. We will add one more rule to it which will be HTTPS and it will be source anywhere, after that we will click on Review and launch.7. Here we will select a keypair and then click on launch. In 1 minute your instance will be created in which ubuntu will be installed.		
			Add Elastic IP to the Server		
		Now we will assign an elastic IP address to our ec2 instance so that if ever we stop this instance then our IP will not change.To make the IP address elastic, we will first go to Network and Security from the menu and from there we will click on Elastic IP.Here we will click on Allocate Elastic IP address and then click on Allocate which will give us an Elastic IP address.  Now we will click on that IP address and there will be the option of associate IP address, on which we will click and then select the instance we just created and then click on associate IP address. We have now assigned our instance an elastic IP address.		
			Point Webserver to Domain		
		To point the domain to the website, we first have to go to Instances where we will select our instance and then copy the public IP address of that instance.Now we will go to the DNS settings of our domain provider and then in the DNS settings we will add an A record which will point above this IP address.		
			Connect to the instance		
		To connect to the instance, we will first go to the instances and then select the instance we have and here we will get the option of connect, on which we will click, after clicking on it, we will click on the session manager and then click on connect. This will allow us to open Cloudshell in our browser and run commands without having to use SSH or putty.		
			Install Apache2 and php8		
		1. After logging in to the Cloudshell we'll have to first update our index packages.		
			sudo apt-get update		
		2. After this we will enter another command. With this command we will add an apt repository to the server.		
			sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php		
		3. Now we will install PHP 8 in our server, for which we will type this command. Now apache and php8 are installed in our web server.		
			sudo apt-get install php8.0 -y		
		4. After this we have to restart our server, for which we will type this command. By typing this command, our apache server will restart.		
			sudo systemctl restart apache2		
		5. Now we have to enter a command to start apache automatically on rebooting our apache server. With the help of this command if we ever reboot our apache server, then with the help of this command our apache server will be enabled automatically.		
			sudo systemctl enable apache2		
			Create Virtual Host in the Webserver		
		Now we have to put some code in a configuration file which I have given below, you just have to enter your domain name instead of yourdomain.com.		
			&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName yourdomain.com
  ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/smm
    ServerAdmin admin@yourdomain.com
    ErrorLog /var/www/vhosts/logs/error_log
  &lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;
  AllowOverride All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
		
		Copy the line of this code and then type the command given below.		
			sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf		
		And click Enter, after which the vim editor will open here, where we have to paste the above config file code we have copied here. Now save it and then restart the apache server.Now we have to create a folder		
			sudo mkdir /var/www/smm		
			cd /var/www/smm		
			ls		
			Install Certbot and Install SSL		
		First of all, we have to install Core, for which you will type this command.		
			sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core		
		After which you will install Certbot. For this use this command.		
			sudo snap install --classic certbot		
		After Certbot is installed, we will run Certbot for which we will use this command.		
			sudo certbot --apache		
		Now certbot will ask us for an email which you can enter any of your email after which it will ask 2 questions which we have to click on Y. And then it will ask us the names of the domains on which we want to install SSL.Select the domain and press enter after selecting it. Now it will generate and issue SSL certificate for that domain.We have now installed SSL in our ubuntu server.And finally we will create an index.php file for which we will type this command.		
			sudo vi index.php		
		After this, a php file will be created and saved in it. And this is how we can install SSL certificate in our ubuntu web server which is hosted on amazon aws, that too for absolutely free.",

				"articleBody": "Few days back I saw a question on Quora that \"How to install WordPress with XAMPP\". And in response to this question, I thought why not write a detailed blog post on this topic.If you also want to come into the world of blogging and start your own WordPress blog but do not want to spend money during the development of the blog, then you can create a blog by installing your WordPress blog on local host in your own computer.
Which you can later migrate and deploy in a web hosting.		
			Installing WordPress in XAMPP - Install XAMPP - 		
		1. First of all we have to download XAMPP for which we will go to its official site - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and download XAMPP from here according to your operating system.		
																														
		2. Now we will locate the .exe file of XAMPP and run it.
																														
		3. After running the exe file, the setup wizard of Xampp will open in which we just have to click on Next. If you want, you can change the installation directory.		
																														
		4. After this XAMPP will be installed in your computer.

		1. Now we have to create a database in phpmyadmin for which we will type \" https://localhost/phpmyadmin/ \" in any web browser.		
																														
		2. After going to this address, we will click on the database.3. After this we have to give a name to the database which will be the name of the folder in which we extracted the WordPress files. In my case it is localsite. After entering the name, press the create button, which will create a database.
																														
			Install WordPress on Localhost - 		
		1. Now we will close phpmyadmin and then type ( \" https://localhost/localsite \" ) in the web browser. Where we will complete the installation of wordpress. After visiting this link, we have to select the language of WordPress.		
																														
		2. After this we will click on continue and then we have to give the name of the database which we have given in phpmyadmin. And then give root to the username in it and click on submit. After clicking on submit, we have to click on \"Run the Installation\".		
																														
		
3. Now we will give a name to our website and then we add a username and a password. Click on the button of Confirm use of weak password. And finally enter your email / gmail in it so that if you forget your password in future then you can reset it.		
																														
		4. Now click on \"Install WordPress\" and then after installing, login by clicking Log In. To login to WordPress regularly, go to https://localhost/localsite/wp-admin/ and login with your username and password.
																														
		5. WordPress has now been installed and you can now create your website in it.
