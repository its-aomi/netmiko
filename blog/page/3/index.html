				"articleBody": "Today I will walk you through the steps to install the full version of Kali Linux on your Android phone without root. The version of kali that we are going to install on our android device is called Kali NetHunter.What is Kali Nethunter -  Kali NetHunter is an Android-based penetration testing platform that provides an interactive and user-friendly environment to perform a variety of network security-related tasks.
Kali NetHunter is a customized version of Kali Linux which has been pre-installed on an Android device. It includes all the tools present in the Kali Linux distribution, but it supports wireless networks and has been optimized for touchscreen devices.		
			Download Requirements for Kali NetHunter 		
		Before starting the installation process of Kali Linux on our Android device we will need to first download some requirements that we will need in order to run and install Kali Linux NetHunter.To download and install Kali Linux NetHunter will need to first install Termux, NetHunter-KeX client, and Hacker’s keyboard.
Here termux is used to download and install Kali Linux NetHunter, NetHunter-KeX is used to run the GUI ( Graphical user interface ) and the hacker’s keyboard is a helpful virtual keyboard containing all the symbols required in the kali terminal.		
			Download Termux - 
		
		To download Termux, first, open your google play store and search for \"Termux\", here click on Install to install the Termux app. You can also download and install the termux app from its official website at - https://termux.com. If you downloaded Termux from the play store then you might get a “repository under maintenance error” which you can fix by changing the repo of termux, just enter the command given below in the terminal - 		
			termux-change-repo		
		
		This will display a popup where the main repository will be selected by default, now all you need to do is select all three repositories, main, game, and science. Once done click on “OK” to save it.		
																														
		After that you will need to select the mirror, the “official repositories” will be selected by default, change it to “Mirrors by Grimler” after that click on OK to save it.		
																														
		If you are still getting a repository under maintenance error then just download Termux from F-Droid, as the play store version of Termux is not maintained. Get Termux from F-Droid.
			Download Kali NetHunter App Store & KEX -		
		Kali Nethunter App Store is required to install all other things that we will need to install and run Kali NetHunter on our Android device.Download the Nethunter App store by going to https://store.nethunter.com/ and clicking on “DOWNLOAD STORE APP” which will download the NetHunter app store apk.		
																														
		Once downloaded, install the app and continue to the next step which is to download NetHunter kex.
Open the NetHunter App Store and at the bottom, you will get a search button, search for Nethunter Kex, click on it and click on Install. 		
																														
		Once the download finishes you might need to allow NetHunter Store to install apps from unknown sources, open settings and allow it, and install NetHunter Kex.NetHunter kex is required to run Kali Linux Nethunter using the graphical user interface aka GUI. If you want you can also use Kali Linux using just its command line.
			Download Hacker’s Keyboard -		
		You can download Hacker’s Keyboard from Playstore or NetHunter App Store, just search for Hacker’s Keyboard on Play Store or NetHunter Play Store and download it and install it.After installing it, open it and follow the steps to set it up. NOTE: Hacker’s keyboard is optional, you can also use your default keyboard on Termux or Kali Linux.		
			Install Kali Linux NetHunter		
		Okay so now let us see how we can download and install Kali Linux NetHunter on our Android device using termux, to begin first open your termux app and update its packages.		
			pkg update -y
		
		
		Now setup the storage of termux using the command below, you might get a popup asking you to allow termux storage permissions, accept it to continue- 		
			termux-setup-storage
		
		After that you will need to download and install wget which we will need to download kali Linux, you can download and install wget on termux using this command -		
			pkg install wget -y
		
		Once wget is installed, you can now download kali, do note that in order to run and use Kali Linux NetHunter on your Android device you will need at least 10GB of free space, so make sure to have some empty storage for the installation. 		
			wget -O install-nethunter-termux https://offs.ec/2MceZWr 		
		
		Once Kali Linux Nethunter finishes downloading you will need to make the downloaded file executable to install it, use this command to make the downloaded kali Linux file executable - 		
			chmod +x install-nethunter-termux		
		Now run the script which will download the full version of Kali Linux NetHunter, it will take a few minutes to complete, so keep the termux app in Foreground and wait for the installation to complete. 		
			./install-nethunter-termux
		
		Once Kali Linux NetHunter is fully downloaded and installed it will ask you for input at the end of the installation process, the question will be “ Delete downloaded Rootfs file”, just enter “y” and click enter to finish the installation.		
																														
		
		Once done, make sure to update kali packages using the command - 		
			sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y
		
		And that's it, that's how you can install Kali Linux on your Android device without root, now after the installation finishes, you will be in the command line interface of Kali Linux where you can do anything you want. Use command “nethunter” to enter the CLI, or use “nethunter -r” to enter root.Now for users that want a GUI interface instead of using just the command line, you can follow the rest of the steps below.
			Run Kali Linux NetHunter GUI 		
		To use Kali Linux NetHunter in GUI mode, you will need to first set a kex password, you can set a kex password by entering the following command -		
			kex passwd		
		After entering the command, you will need to enter a password, verify the password, and once done you will need to type “kex” in the terminal to know your RFB Port.		
			kex 
		
		After entering the kex command, in the terminal, you will get the RFB Port number.
Now go back and open the NetHunter Kex app, here if it asks for storage permissions then allow it, after that on the right side of localhost:1 there will be a port number, you will need to remove the default port number and enter your RFB Port number here.After that below in the VNC Password, enter the kex password and click on “Connect” at the top right corner.		
																														
		You will now be in the GUI interface of Kali Linux NetHunter, you can use a mouse or your fingers to control it, it will work just like the Kali Linux PC, it will have everything that is available in the original Kali Linux.
To exit Kali Linux NetHunter, go back to Temux and enter “kex stop” to stop the server. And that's it, that is how you can use Kali Linux NetHunter in GUI using NetHunter Kex.

				"articleBody": "Today I will walk you through the steps to install Scikit-learn on your Ubuntu 20.04, you will get step-by-step instructions on how you can Install Scikit-learn on your ubuntu. Now, before starting the installation, let's see what Scikit-learn is.What is Scikit-learn - Scikit-learn is a free software library for the python programming language. It provides machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model selection. Scikit-learn provides a simple interface to these algorithms so that they can be applied to various real-world problems.How to Install Scikit Learn on Ubuntu 20.04Watch this video on YouTube
			Update and Upgrade		
		Before starting the installation of sci-kit learn make sure to update and upgrade your apt packages using the commands -		
			sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get upgrade		
		Once done, you can now proceed to the installation process, do note that you will need sudo permissions in order to install sci-kit learn, so make sure you have sudo permissions.		
			Install Requirements 
		
		To be able to run Sci-kit Learn you will need Numpy, Scipy and the latest version of Python installed on your ubuntu, if you already have the required packages installed then scroll down to the installation process.
If you don't then here are the steps to install pip3, Scipy, Numpy, and Python3 -		
			Install / Update Python3 - 
		
		To install or update Python you will need to use the apt-get command in the terminal, open the terminal and enter the following command - 		
			sudo apt-get install python3 -y		
		This command will install the latest version of python3, which we will need to install Sci-kit Learn.		
			Install pip3 -		
		
To be able to install Sci-kit, scipy, and Numpy you will need pip3, now to install pip3 or to update it to the latest version you can use this command -		
			sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip		
			Install Numpy and Scipy - 
		
		Once pip3 is installed you can now install Numpy and Scipy using the commands given here - To install Numpy use this command - 		
			python3 -m pip install --user numpy		
		To install Scipy use this command - 		
			python3 -m pip install --user scipy
		
		
Once all the requirements are satisfied for the installation of Sci-kit Learn, you can now start the installation of Scikit.		
			Install Sci-kit Learn		
		The installation process of Sci-kit Learn is very easy, all you need to do is enter a single command, the command to install sci-kit learn on ubuntu 20.04 is - 		
			pip3 install -U scikit-learn		
																														
		Once the installation of Scikit finishes, you can verify whether sci-kit learn was installed properly or not by entering this command in the terminal -		
			python3 -m pip show scikit-learn		
		
After you enter this command in the terminal window, you will see an output in the terminal that will say the name of the package that is “scikit-learn” and the version of the package. If it says command not found that means you did something wrong.		
																														
		Try to install it once again if you are facing any problem while installing scikit-learn.		
			Install Sci-kit Learn using Conda
		
		Now if you have Anaconda installed on your ubuntu then you can easily install Sci-kit learn using a single command, if you don't have Anaconda installed on your ubuntu then you can follow this tutorial on Installing Anaconda on Ubuntu 20.04, which will show you how you can install Anaconda.
Now to install Sci-kit Learn using conda you can enter this command in the terminal where conda is active - 		
			conda install scikit-learn
		
		This command will install Sci-kit on your ubuntu using conda, now to verify the installation enter the command “conda list scikit-learn”.		
			Using Sci-kit Learn 
		
		To use sci-kit learn you will need to use import, use “import sklearn” to use Scikit learn on your projects.		
			Avoid Conflicts 		
		
		If you don't want scikit to learn to conflict with other packages installed on your ubuntu then what you can do is create a virtual Python environment or a Conda Environment, this will keep the scikit learn separate from other packages on your ubuntu thus avoiding conflicts from them.Installing Scikit-learn in a virtual environment will be a better idea as you don't want conflicts creating problems with the installation or regular usage.And that's it, that is how you can install Sci-kit Learn on your ubuntu 20.04 using python and conda, if you are facing any problem while installing scikit-learn then comment below, thank you.",

				"articleBody": "Today in this tutorial I will walk you through the steps to set up Ads.txt on your ezoic approved website that is required for ezoic to display advertisements on your website. I will show you three ways that you can use to set up ads.txt for ezoic.What is Ads.txt and Ads.txt Manager - Ads.txt (Authorized digital sellers) is a text file that contains all the digital sellers that are authorized to sell the ad inventory of your website. This means that only the sellers and resells listed on your ads.txt file will be able to sell your ad inventory.
Ads.txt Manager is a free tool that allows you to manage and maintain your ads.txt, with the help of this tool you can keep your ads.txt fresh and safe from unauthorized sellers. Okay, now we know what ads.txt and ads.txt manager are so let us see how we can set up ads.txt on ezoic.		
			Setup Ezoic Ads.txt Manually 
		
		To set up the ads.txt of your ezoic approved website manually using ads.txt manager, you will need to first create an account on adstxtmanager.com.To create an account on adstxtmanager, first, visit its official website at - https://www.adstxtmanager.com and on the homepage click on “Get Started Now”.		
																														
		
Now on the register page, you will need to create a free adstxtmanager account, here you will need to enter your website name(domain name), email, password, name, company. Once all the details have been filled in, accept the terms and click on “Create My Account”.Once the account is created, log in to the adstxtmanager dashboard by going to https://svc.adstxtmanager.com/auth/login, Now in the dashboard click on “Get Started”, in “what is ads.txt” click on next.		
																														
		In the \"Authorize\" tab scroll down and look for Ezoic &amp; Google AdSense (if you also have AdSense approved), Authorize both Ezoic and Google Adsense, and go back up and click on next.		
																														
		
		In the \"Import\" tab if you already have an ads.txt file that you want to use then you can import it to your adstxtmanager by clicking on “Import ads.txt”, for a regular user like you and me scroll down and click on next.On the \"Redirect\" tab copy the Account ID that is shown there, after that click on next. 		
																														
		Now go to your ezoic dashboard, go to the monetization tab and scroll down to find the Ads.txt settings, Click on “Manual Setup” which will open the ads.txt manager settings of ezoic.
Here in the \"Instructions\" tab click on next, after that in the \"ads.txt manager\" tab paste the Account ID that you got from the adstxtmanager website. Select your domain and click on save to continue.		
																														
		In the \"Setup Redirect\" tab, turn on Ads.txt manager and click on Verify. If everything was done properly then in the Verification tab you will see a green Status Complete. Do note that it might take a few minutes for the integration to complete, so click on verify after a few minutes if it throws an error.		
																														
		
Once the verification is complete in Ezoic, go back to adstxtmanager and click on next which will bring the validate tab, here click on RE-VALIDATE SITE, if the verification was successful in ezoic then in adstxtmanger it will also say Integrated.		
																														
		To check if the ads.txt file is working on your website or not just go to your_domain.com/ads.txt which will display your ads.txt file that looks like this - 		
																														
		That's it, that's how you can set up ads.txt on ezoic manually using adstxtmanager, now let's see the automatic method to set up ads.txt on ezoic.
			Setup Ezoic Ads.txt Automatically 		
		To set up ads.txt automatically on ezoic you will need to first go to the monetization tab then scroll down to the ads.txt section. Here you will get two options- Manual and Automatic, click on the Automatic Setup.First click on create to create an ads.txt manager account (it's automatic so no need to fill up any form), After that in the preview ads.txt scroll down and click on next.Now in the “Edit entries'' tab click on “Add a network” if you want to also add your Google AdSense account to ads.txt, if you don't want to then click on Next.
After that in “Ads.txt Setup” select your domain and click on Verify.If the integration is successful then you will see a green Status complete output. Click on done to close the ads.txt settings.		
			Setup Ezoic Ads.txt using Plugin
		
		If you want, you can also set up the ads.txt of ezoic using a WordPress plugin, although this method is not recommended as the fewer plugins in a website the better, still, if you want then here are the steps.		
		To begin, you will need to first Copy your Account ID from the adstxtmanager website, you can get the Account ID by logging in to https://www.adstxtmanager.com/ then clicking on the top right corner menu, this will show you your Account ID.
Copy the Account ID then log in to your WordPress admin, go to Plugins&gt;Add New then search for “Ads.txt Manager” install the plugin, and activate it.		
																														
		Now you can access the settings of the Ads.txt Manager plugin by going to Settings&gt;Ads.txt Manager Settings. In the settings, all you will need to do is paste your Account ID and then click on Save.		
																														
		That's it, your ads.txt should now work, it can be accessed at - your_domain.com/ads.txt.
			Conclusion - 		
		Setting up an ads.txt on your ezoic website is fairly easy and should just take around 5 - 10 mins, the setup method that is recommended is the automatic one which is very easy to do, no complicated stuff. If you are facing any problem then comment below (Do remember that sometimes it might take some time for the ads.txt integration to complete). Thank you.",

				"articleBody": "Having a faster page loading speed is always beneficial, it will help in ranking your blog posts higher, making the user experience better and overall make your blog look more professional. Now, if you have a blog that has ezoic integrated into it then you can get all those benefits on your blog by using a tool by ezoic called Ezoic Leap.		
			What is Ezoic Leap?		
		Ezoic Leap is a website optimization tool by ezoic that helps in optimizing your blog to increase its speed and performance. It has lots of different features that you can use like a content delivery network, image optimization tools, code optimization tools, etc.		
																														
		It also has features that will help you identify the cause of a slow-loading website and will provide you with possible fixes for it. Leap is free for all the ezoic users that have their website monetized using ezoic.		
			Why use Ezoic Leap?
		
		
Do you want your blog to rank higher than the existing blogs on the internet? Then you must use Leap, leap will make your blog perform faster and will make it pass the core web vitals by google, which is now a ranking factor for all the blogs on the internet.Now you must be thinking how would I check whether my blog passes the core web vitals or not? Well, there is a tool by Google called PageSpeed Insights that will help you know how your blog performs.This tool will crawl your blog and check for all the things like Html loading speed, CSS loading speed, image loading speed, etc and will provide you with a score for both mobile and desktop, the scoring system works like this 0-49 (Fail) 50-89 (Acceptable) 90-100 (Good).		
																														
		If your blog falls in the fail or the Acceptable category then it's time that you should start using Ezoic Leap, otherwise, you will have a hard time ranking on google.
			Optimization Settings of Ezoic Leap to Use and Not use		
		Okay, we now know what leap is and why we should use it, so let's now see what are the optimization settings that leap provides for making our website Core Web Vital friendly aka “A fast and optimized website”.		
			CDN & Caching 
		
		Now if you don't know what a CDN is then its basically a group of data centers/servers that that helps in distributing the content of your website at higher speeds to the user, these servers are distributed around the globe which means that these servers will serve the user with the cached content of your website instead of your web server where your website is hosted.So if a user from India requests for a file from your web host that is in the United States then instead of your web host providing the file from the United States server, the Ezoic Leap CDN servers located in India or close to the user that has the file cached with them will provide the user with the requested file.This lowers the latency of your website and makes it faster.
			CSS Optimization		
		Ezoic Leap provides you with four optimization features to optimize the delivery of the CSS files of your website to the user, these optimization features are - Critical CSS, Remove Unused CSS, Optimise Fonts, and Preload Fonts.		
																														
		Critical CSS - This Leap optimization feature helps in loading the required stylesheets that make up the top part of a website that you see whenever you load a webpage, it helps in displaying the top parts of your website as fast as possible.Stylesheets that are required to render the top part of a website are loaded in the &lt;head&gt; of Html to make it render first and prevent any render-blocking.Should I use the Critical CSS optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, it helps in improving the First Contentful Paint.
		Remove Unused CSS - Unused CSS is one thing that almost all websites face whenever running a page speed test using Page Insights, this means that your website is loading CSS stylesheets that are not required for that page, Thus its wasting resources and increasing the time it takes for your website to load.And now this is where the Remove Unused CSS optimization feature by Ezoic Leap comes into play, the Remove Unused CSS feature as the name says, it removes the unused CSS from your website making it load faster and saving resources. Should I use the Remove Unused CSS optimization feature of Leap? The answer is, It Depends. This feature can sometimes break the styling of your website, so after enabling this feature make sure to use multiple devices to check whether your website is functioning properly or not..
		Optimize Fonts - This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap is aimed at optimizing the delivery of the fonts of your website, it helps in making the priority of loading the custom fonts higher, if the custom font takes a lot of time to load then the custom font is replaced by the default font of the user's browser.There is also a sub-option that is called “Allow slow loading fonts”, this feature lazy loads the fonts, which means that the default font of the website is slowly replaced by the custom font that you are using on your website.Should I use the Optimize Fonts feature of Leap? The answer is YES, it's a great feature that helps in improving the CLS (Content Layout Shift) of your website in PageSpeed Insights that is caused by fonts not loading faster. Allow slow loading fonts is not recommended to use.
		Preload Fonts -This is another Ezoic Leap optimization feature aimed at the delivery of fonts that are loaded through external CSS files, it makes the external fonts load faster to avoid any render-blocking from font loading from an external CSS file.Should I use the Preload Fonts optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, most of the websites today use google fonts, which means that these fonts are loaded from an external CSS file and can cause Render blocking if not loaded properly.Render Blocking can drop your Core Web Vital score by a lot, that is why this feature is a must use in Ezoic Leap.The Ezoic Leap CSS optimization features that I use on my website are - Critical CSS, Optimize Fonts, and Preload Fonts.
			Minify 		
		Thousands of lines of code can make your website slow. This is why Ezoic Leaps gives us the feature to lower the size of the website’s CSS, Html, js files of our website aka minify it.		
																														
		What is does it that it removes all the white spaces between the lines of the source codes of our website, the white spaces between the Html, CSS, js files take up a lot of extra space that makes the size of the files bigger, these codes are written to be understood by humans easily that is why they are formatted in an understandable manner.  Ezoic leap removes the white spaces from the source code and makes it easier for browsers to render the website faster. The Ezoic Leap Minify feature has three options that you can turn on - Minify Javascript, Minify CSS, and Minify HTML.
Should I use the Minify optimization features of Leap? The answer is YES. If it doesn't break your website. Try to turn on these features one by one and check your website’s mobile and desktop version to see if it's properly working or not.NOTE: Some common problems that you might face when turning on Minify settings are - CSS not Rendering, Icons not working, Menus not working. Search not working and Features that use javascript not working.		
			Image Optimization 		
		Ezoic Leap has some very helpful optimization features for Optimizing the images on our website, features like Next-gen Formats, Image Resizing, Lazy Loading, Explicit Height and Width, and preload Background images are some nice features to have for optimizing the images on our website. 		
																														
		
		Lazy Load Images - High-quality images on a website can have a huge impact on the loading speed of the webpage if, for example, you have 4 images on your blog post that are 3MB in size, so in total it will be 12MB, now the user's browser will keep loading the page until all the resources have been downloaded which will make the loading speed of your post very slow.This is why we should use the Lazy Load Images feature of ezoic leap that will only load the images that are in the view of the user and not all the images on the blog post.Should I use the Lazy Load Images feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this is a very important feature and is a must-use one.
		Next-Gen Formats - Webp images which are a new type of images designed to be lower in file size than typical jpg, png images, it is supported by almost all the modern browsers.Webp images on average are 40% lower in file size than jpeg, which makes it the most suitable image format for websites, as it takes low bandwidth.The Next-gen Formats optimization feature of ezoic leap will convert the images of your website on the fly and serve it to the users as webp, this will help in making the page load speed faster and if in case the user’s browser doesn't support webp, then ezoic leap will serve them the original image.Should I use the Next-gen Formats optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, google recommends webmasters use this new generation of image format on their blogs.
		Resize Images - This feature of ezoic leap helps in reducing the file size of the images by resizing them based on the user's device, generally, the size of images on a website remains the same on different devices, which means that the high-quality images served to the desktop users of your website are also served to the mobile users.Now mobile users don't need that much high-quality images, which means that your website is just wasting resources and page speed on it, now to fix that you can use the Resize images feature of ezoic leap that will resize the images without the image losing its quality for different devices.Should I use the Resize Images optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this optimization feature helps save a lot of bandwidth and also makes the page load speed faster.
		Preload Background Images -This optimization feature of ezoic leap prevents the large background images on your website from loading until all the stylesheets have finished loading.If you have a huge background image on your website that is very big and loads very slow, then this feature is something that you should use that will stop the loading of the image until all the other stylesheets have been rendered on your website.Should I use the Preload Background Images optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this helps a lot if you have a large background image, as the background image will delay the rendering of stylesheets of your sheets which is not good for core web vitals.
		Set Explicit Width and Height - When running PageSpeed Insights you might sometimes get a warning asking you to set Explicit width and height to the images of your website, this warning means that the images on your website doesn't have any fixed height and width set.This means that the user's browser doesn't know how much space to keep for the image to load which causes a lot of Layout shift as the images displace other elements on your webpage which can affect your core web vitals. Learn more about this here.Should I use the Set Explicit Width and Height optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, CLS can be very frustrating for users as during the page load the elements of your website keep moving here and there causing lots of misclicks, to fix this you must turn this feature ON.
			Script Execution 
		
		Ads scripts are one of the biggest reasons for a slow website, these scripts load very slow causing your website to slow down and perform worse on the core web vitals, this happens because of the external scripts that the ad networks use that are very slow causing render-blocking on your website.Ezoic Leap tries to reduce the impact of scripts on your website with a few sets of tools like - scripts delaying and slowing high CPU usage scripts.		
																														
		
Script Delay - This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap delays the loading and execution of all the JavaScript files in your website and lets the browsers first render the website properly, after that the JavaScript will start loading and executing.With this feature enabled the ads and other features of your website that use JavaScript will work only after the page has rendered properly, this means that the high priority things like text, images will load first and then the low priority things like ads will load after that.Should I use the Script Delay optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, ads and other scripts on your website can make your site’s speed horrible, to reduce the impact of scripts on your website use the script delay feature of Ezoic Leap.
		Reduce CPU Intensive Tasks - This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap also works the same as Scripts delay, it mainly targets the CPU intensive scripts that use a lot of CPU processing power and delay it until all the other things on your website have been rendered.		
		jQuery Loading Method - Okay, so you might have heard of jQuery? It's a JavaScript library that is used to add lots of different features to a website, from animations to menus, it is used a lot in WordPress plugins and that is where the problem comes from. Now the problem with jQuery is that it is very slow. It takes a lot of time to load and can cause render-blocking. Now if you have scripts delayed function enabled then the jQuery files will be delayed until all the other things have been rendered.This works great but can sometimes break the functionality of your website, this is why instead of delaying it you can use the jQuery Loading Method of Ezoic Leap.
The jQuery Loading Method will load a smaller script with the core functionality until all the other things have been rendered, after that it will add the main jQuery file to the queue so that your website won't break and will load the jquery at the end without affecting the speed of your website.You can choose one option from the two in this feature, the first one is to load tiny scripts also called jQuery Feature Preload, or you can just load the entire jQuery using a CDN.Should I use the jQuery Loading Method optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this is a great feature that helps in loading those slow jquery files without affecting your website speed. The jQuery Feature Preload is recommended to use instead of CDN.
			Static Asset Cache Policy
		
		The Static Asset Cache Policy is a Ezoic Leap feature tells the user's browser that visited your website once to cache the static assets of your website, which means that if that visitor visited your website again then there will be no need to download those static assets again.		
																														
		Static assets like images, CSS, js will get cached in the user's browser and if the user visits your website again then the browser won't need to request the same file again from your website. Should I use the Static Assets optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES.
			Content Settings 
		
		The content settings feature in ezoic leap is used for optimizing the iframes and excluding specific scripts, it also has an option that lets you optimize embedded Twitter tweets which cause slowness to websites when used. 		
																														
		Lazy load Iframes - This optimization feature of Ezoic leap Lazy loads iframes that you add into your website, it works just the same as Lazy loading images, the iframes are loaded only when the iframe is in the user's view.		
		Optimize Tweets - Just like YouTube embeds, Twitter embeds can also make your website very slow, it causes a lot of render-blocking and downloads a lot of extra files that are not needed for your webpage.
What Optimizes Tweets feature of ezoic does is that it creates a static version of the embedded tweet which means that it will be much faster than the dynamic twitter embed.		
		Remove Scripts or Styles - The remove Scripts or Styles feature of ezoic leap gives us the option to exclude any unused scripts or styles from our website’s frontend, if used properly without breaking your site, this feature can increase your core web vitals ranking by a lot.Should I use the Content optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, use the safe ones like optimize iframes and optimize tweets, the other option that allows us to exclude scripts and styles should be only used by professionals.
			Pre-Connect 		
		Pre-connect is the last Optimization settings that ezoic leap provides. It is used to tell the user's browser to Pre-connect to external resources that a website is going to fetch. It helps a lot if you use external fonts, images, videos or CSS, Html.		
																														
		Should I use the Pre-Connect optimization settings of Leap? The answer is YES, turn both the pre-connect and pre-connect origin settings on because almost every website uses something that is fetched from an external site.Okay, so those were the optimization settings that ezoic leap provides to make our website faster and core web vital friendly, now before finishing up the post I would also like to talk about a feature that ezoic leap provides, that feature is Technologies.
			Ezoic Leap Technologies 		
		The Technologies tab in leap is a recommendation from ezoic on what things you need to fix on your website to make it faster, they will give you the name of the technology you are currently using and its rating.		
																														
		If you want to use a faster alternative of that technology then on the right side of that technology click on  “View Alternatives” which will provide you with a list of alternatives that are faster than the current technology that you are using.These recommendations can be very helpful if you want to have a faster website.
			Must use Ezoic Leap settings for Faster Page Speed		
		Okay, so here are the Best Ezoic Leap settings that I am using on my blogs and you should too.Critical CSS - Helps improve First Contentful PaintOptimize Fonts - Optimizes Fonts DeliveryPreload Fonts - Preloads External Fonts fasterMinify HTML - Not using CSS,JS as my site breaks down when i use those.All Image optimization settings - Use all of these, if the images don't break.Script Delay - To delay ads script and javascripts for faster rendering of page.Reduce CPU intensive Tasks - To delay CPU intensive scripts.jQuery Loading Method - Loading jQuery from CDN, use Preload if the site doesn't break.Static Asset Cache Policy - Everything turned on.Lazy load iframes - Helps optimize youtube videos and other functions using iframe.Optimize tweets - Helps optimize TweetsPre-connect -Both preconnect option on.Okay so these are the settings that i am using on my blogs along with Ezoic Cache, if something doesn't work for you, like it breaks your website or something then don't use it.
			Conclusion		
		Now, coming to the conclusion, if your website has ads then there is no way that you can achieve a 100 out of 100 score on PageSpeed Insights because you cannot control the speed of the ad scripts, but you can perform a good enough score if you use Ezoic Leap to optimize your website.I did a PageSpeed Insights test of a blog with and without Ezoic Leap activated and here are the results - 		
																														
		On average the website got almost 69% faster when Ezoic Leap was used. That's a lot of improvement if you ask me. That is why I recommend you to use the Ezoic leap settings that I provided and believe me, you won't be disappointed. Thank you for Reading...",

				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can install NLTK ( Natural Language Toolkit ) on your Ubuntu 20.04 using Python. What is NLTK - NLTK is a Python package that provides tools for Natural Language Processing. It provides many different algorithms, which are used to analyze the text and give the answer to questions like sentiment analysis, syntax parsing, part-of-speech tagging, etc.It’s mainly used for linguistic data processing, which means it processes the data to extract the relevant information.Before starting the installation make sure that you have root permissions for your ubuntu system, as we will need root permissions for installing NLTK.		
			Update and Upgrade		
		Okay, so the first step for us will be to update our index packages and also upgrade the downloaded latest packages, you can do that by entering these two commands given below in the terminal.		
			sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade		
		Now to Install NLTK you will need python and pip3 installed on your ubuntu, let’s see how you can install python and pip3 for installing NLTK.		
			Install Python and pip3		
		Now, installing python and pip3 is very easy, to begin first open a terminal window and type the command given below to install python -		
			sudo apt-get install python3		
		To install pip3 you will need to run this command -		
			sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip		
		Now after installing python and pip3, you can start the installation of NLTK on your ubuntu 20.04.		
			Install NLTK
		
		To install NLTK first open a terminal window and in the terminal window type the pip3 command given below which will start the download of NLTK on your ubuntu.		
			sudo pip3 install nltk		
		You might need to enter your password to use the sudo command, after entering your password, the download of nltk will start.Once NLTK finishes downloading, you will need to import NLTK using the import command, you can do that by first entering the following command to open python.		
			python3		
		After entering inside python you will need to use the import command. This will take a little bit of time.		
			import nltk		
		Once the import finishes, the last step will be to download all the nltk packages using the nltk.download command, this will download all the packages you will need for nltk  -		
			nltk.download(&lsquo;all-nltk&rsquo;)
		
			Uninstall NLTK		
		Now, if you want to uninstall NLTK from your ubuntu then you can do that by using pip3, the command format for uninstalling NLTK will be “ pip3 uninstall &lt;package-name&gt; “, where package name will be the name of the library/module that you want to uninstall.
