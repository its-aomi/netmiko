<p>If your blog falls in the fail or the Acceptable category then it&#8217;s time that you should start using Ezoic Leap, otherwise, you will have a hard time ranking on google.</p>
<h2>Optimization Settings of Ezoic Leap to Use and Not use</h2>
<p>Okay, we now know what leap is and why we should use it, so let&#8217;s now see what are the optimization settings that leap provides for making our website Core Web Vital friendly aka “A fast and optimized website”.</p>

<h3>CDN &#038; Caching<br>
</h3>
<p>Now if you don&#8217;t know what a CDN is then its basically a group of data centers/servers that that helps in distributing the content of your website at higher speeds to the user, these servers are distributed around the globe which means that these servers will serve the user with the cached content of your website instead of your web server where your website is hosted.</p>
<p>So if a user from India requests for a file from your web host that is in the United States then instead of your web host providing the file from the United States server, the Ezoic Leap CDN servers located in India or close to the user that has the file cached with them will provide the user with the requested file.</p>
<p>This lowers the latency of your website and makes it faster.</p>

<h3>CSS Optimization</h3>
<p>Ezoic Leap provides you with four optimization features to optimize the delivery of the CSS files of your website to the user, these optimization features are &#8211; Critical CSS, Remove Unused CSS, Optimise Fonts, and Preload Fonts.</p>
<p>															<img width="1024" height="480" src="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-css-optimization-settings-1024x480.png.webp" alt="ezoic leap css optimization settings" loading="lazy" srcset="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-css-optimization-settings-1024x480.png.webp 1024w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-css-optimization-settings-300x141.png.webp 300w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-css-optimization-settings-768x360.png.webp 768w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-css-optimization-settings.png.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">															</p>
<h4><b>Critical CSS &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>This Leap optimization feature helps in loading the required stylesheets that make up the top part of a website that you see whenever you load a webpage, it helps in displaying the top parts of your website as fast as possible.</p>
<div class="PvWd7JQt" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">
<!-- Ezoic - incontent_6 - incontent_6 -->
<div>
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655"> </div>
</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_6 - incontent_6 -->
</div>
<p>Stylesheets that are required to render the top part of a website are loaded in the &lt;head&gt; of Html to make it render first and prevent any render-blocking.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Critical CSS optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, it helps in improving the First Contentful Paint.</p>
<h4><b>Remove Unused CSS &#8211;</b></h4>
<p> Unused CSS is one thing that almost all websites face whenever running a page speed test using Page Insights, this means that your website is loading CSS stylesheets that are not required for that page, Thus its wasting resources and increasing the time it takes for your website to load.</p>
<div class="siUHPmmJ" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">
<!-- Ezoic - incontent_7 - incontent_7 -->
<div>
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-656"> </div>
</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_7 - incontent_7 -->
</div>
<p>And now this is where the Remove Unused CSS optimization feature by Ezoic Leap comes into play, the Remove Unused CSS feature as the name says, it removes the unused CSS from your website making it load faster and saving resources. </p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Remove Unused CSS optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is, <em>It Depends</em>. This feature can sometimes break the styling of your website, so after enabling this feature make sure to use multiple devices to check whether your website is functioning properly or not..</p>
<h4><b>Optimize Fonts &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap is aimed at optimizing the delivery of the fonts of your website, it helps in making the priority of loading the custom fonts higher, if the custom font takes a lot of time to load then the custom font is replaced by the default font of the user&#8217;s browser.</p>
<div class="wW1Bo0lG" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">
<!-- Ezoic - incontent_8 - incontent_8 -->
<div>
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-657"> </div>
</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_8 - incontent_8 -->
</div>
<p>There is also a sub-option that is called “<em>Allow slow loading fonts</em>”, this feature lazy loads the fonts, which means that the default font of the website is slowly replaced by the custom font that you are using on your website.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Optimize Fonts feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, it&#8217;s a great feature that helps in improving the CLS (Content Layout Shift) of your website in PageSpeed Insights that is caused by fonts not loading faster. </p>
<p>Allow slow loading fonts is not recommended to use.</p>
<div class="fIsjcdIF" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">
<!-- Ezoic - incontent_9 - incontent_9 -->
<div>
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-658"> </div>
</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_9 - incontent_9 -->
</div>
<h4><b>Preload Fonts &#8211;</b></h4>
<p>This is another Ezoic Leap optimization feature aimed at the delivery of fonts that are loaded through external CSS files, it makes the external fonts load faster to avoid any render-blocking from font loading from an external CSS file.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Preload Fonts optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, most of the websites today use google fonts, which means that these fonts are loaded from an external CSS file and can cause Render blocking if not loaded properly.</p>
<p>Render Blocking can drop your Core Web Vital score by a lot, that is why this feature is a must use in Ezoic Leap.</p>

</div>
<p>The Ezoic Leap CSS optimization features that I use on my website are &#8211; Critical CSS, Optimize Fonts, and Preload Fonts.</p>
<h3>Minify </h3>
<p>Thousands of lines of code can make your website slow. This is why Ezoic Leaps gives us the feature to lower the size of the website’s CSS, Html, js files of our website aka minify it.</p>
<p>															<img width="1024" height="480" src="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-minify-settings-1024x480.png.webp" alt="ezoic leap minify settings" loading="lazy" srcset="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-minify-settings-1024x480.png.webp 1024w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-minify-settings-300x141.png.webp 300w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-minify-settings-768x360.png.webp 768w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-minify-settings.png.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">															</p>

<div>
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-660"> </div>
</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_11 - incontent_11 -->
</div>
<p>What is does it that it removes all the white spaces between the lines of the source codes of our website, the white spaces between the Html, CSS, js files take up a lot of extra space that makes the size of the files bigger, these codes are written to be understood by humans easily that is why they are formatted in an understandable manner.  </p>
<p>Ezoic leap removes the white spaces from the source code and makes it easier for browsers to render the website faster. The Ezoic Leap Minify feature has three options that you can turn on &#8211; Minify Javascript, Minify CSS, and Minify HTML.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Minify optimization features of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>. If it doesn&#8217;t break your website. Try to turn on these features one by one and check your website’s mobile and desktop version to see if it&#8217;s properly working or not.</p>
<div class="e3ttMKS5" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some common problems that you might face when turning on Minify settings are &#8211; CSS not Rendering, Icons not working, Menus not working. Search not working and Features that use javascript not working.</p>
<h3>Image Optimization </h3>
<p>Ezoic Leap has some very helpful optimization features for Optimizing the images on our website, features like Next-gen Formats, Image Resizing, Lazy Loading, Explicit Height and Width, and preload Background images are some nice features to have for optimizing the images on our website. </p>
<p>															<img width="1024" height="480" src="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-image-optimization-settings-1024x480.png.webp" alt="ezoic leap image optimization settings" loading="lazy" srcset="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-image-optimization-settings-1024x480.png.webp 1024w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-image-optimization-settings-300x141.png.webp 300w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-image-optimization-settings-768x360.png.webp 768w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-image-optimization-settings.png.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">															</p>

<h4>
<b>Lazy Load Images </b>&#8211;</h4>
<p> High-quality images on a website can have a huge impact on the loading speed of the webpage if, for example, you have 4 images on your blog post that are 3MB in size, so in total it will be 12MB, now the user&#8217;s browser will keep loading the page until all the resources have been downloaded which will make the loading speed of your post very slow.</p>
<p>This is why we should use the Lazy Load Images feature of ezoic leap that will only load the images that are in the view of the user and not all the images on the blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Lazy Load Images feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, this is a very important feature and is a must-use one.</p>
<div class="vDXzjSYH" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">

</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_14 - incontent_14 -->
</div>
<h4><b>Next-Gen Formats &#8211;</b></h4>
<p> Webp images which are a new type of images designed to be lower in file size than typical jpg, png images, it is supported by almost all the modern browsers.</p>
<p>Webp images on average are 40% lower in file size than jpeg, which makes it the most suitable image format for websites, as it takes low bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Next-gen Formats optimization feature of ezoic leap will convert the images of your website on the fly and serve it to the users as webp, this will help in making the page load speed faster and if in case the user’s browser doesn&#8217;t support webp, then ezoic leap will serve them the original image.</p>
<div class="RTbbv839" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">

</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_15 - incontent_15 -->
</div>
<p><strong>Should I use the Next-gen Formats optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, google recommends webmasters use this new generation of image format on their blogs.</p>
<h4><b>Resize Images &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>This feature of ezoic leap helps in reducing the file size of the images by resizing them based on the user&#8217;s device, generally, the size of images on a website remains the same on different devices, which means that the high-quality images served to the desktop users of your website are also served to the mobile users.</p>
<p>Now mobile users don&#8217;t need that much high-quality images, which means that your website is just wasting resources and page speed on it, now to fix that you can use the Resize images feature of ezoic leap that will resize the images without the image losing its quality for different devices.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Should I use the Resize Images optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, this optimization feature helps save a lot of bandwidth and also makes the page load speed faster.</p>
<h4><b>Preload Background Images &#8211;</b></h4>
<p>This optimization feature of ezoic leap prevents the large background images on your website from loading until all the stylesheets have finished loading.</p>
<p>If you have a huge background image on your website that is very big and loads very slow, then this feature is something that you should use that will stop the loading of the image until all the other stylesheets have been rendered on your website.</p>
<div class="ffXoAWYW" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">

</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_17 - incontent_17 -->
</div>
<p><strong>Should I use the Preload Background Images optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, this helps a lot if you have a large background image, as the background image will delay the rendering of stylesheets of your sheets which is not good for core web vitals.</p>
<h4><strong>Set Explicit Width and Height &#8211; </strong></h4>
<p>When running PageSpeed Insights you might sometimes get a warning asking you to set Explicit width and height to the images of your website, this warning means that the images on your website doesn&#8217;t have any fixed height and width set.</p>
<p>This means that the user&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t know how much space to keep for the image to load which causes a lot of Layout shift as the images displace other elements on your webpage which can affect your core web vitals. Learn more about this <a href="https://web.dev/optimize-cls/#images-without-dimensions">here</a>.</p>

</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_18 - incontent_18 -->
</div>
<p><strong>Should I use the Set Explicit Width and Height optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, CLS can be very frustrating for users as during the page load the elements of your website keep moving here and there causing lots of misclicks, to fix this you must turn this feature ON.</p>
<h3>Script Execution<br>
</h3>
<p>Ads scripts are one of the biggest reasons for a slow website, these scripts load very slow causing your website to slow down and perform worse on the core web vitals, this happens because of the external scripts that the ad networks use that are very slow causing render-blocking on your website.</p>
<p>Ezoic Leap tries to reduce the impact of scripts on your website with a few sets of tools like &#8211; scripts delaying and slowing high CPU usage scripts.</p>

<h4><b>Script Delay &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap delays the loading and execution of all the JavaScript files in your website and lets the browsers first render the website properly, after that the JavaScript will start loading and executing.</p>
<p>With this feature enabled the ads and other features of your website that use JavaScript will work only after the page has rendered properly, this means that the high priority things like text, images will load first and then the low priority things like ads will load after that.</p>

<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_20 - incontent_20 -->
</div>
<p><strong>Should I use the Script Delay optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, ads and other scripts on your website can make your site’s speed horrible, to reduce the impact of scripts on your website use the script delay feature of Ezoic Leap.</p>
<h4><b>Reduce CPU Intensive Tasks &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap also works the same as Scripts delay, it mainly targets the CPU intensive scripts that use a lot of CPU processing power and delay it until all the other things on your website have been rendered.</p>
<h4><b>jQuery Loading Method &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>Okay, so you might have heard of jQuery? It&#8217;s a JavaScript library that is used to add lots of different features to a website, from animations to menus, it is used a lot in WordPress plugins and that is where the problem comes from.</p>
<div class="32J8c83X" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">
<!-- Ezoic - incontent_21 - incontent_21 -->
<div>
<div id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-670"> </div>
</div>
<!-- End Ezoic - incontent_21 - incontent_21 -->
</div>
<p> Now the problem with jQuery is that it is very slow. It takes a lot of time to load and can cause render-blocking. Now if you have scripts delayed function enabled then the jQuery files will be delayed until all the other things have been rendered.</p>
<p>This works great but can sometimes break the functionality of your website, this is why instead of delaying it you can use the jQuery Loading Method of Ezoic Leap.</p>
<p>The jQuery Loading Method will load a smaller script with the core functionality until all the other things have been rendered, after that it will add the main jQuery file to the queue so that your website won&#8217;t break and will load the jquery at the end without affecting the speed of your website.</p>

<p>You can choose one option from the two in this feature, the first one is to load tiny scripts also called jQuery Feature Preload, or you can just load the entire jQuery using a CDN.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use the jQuery Loading Method optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, this is a great feature that helps in loading those slow jquery files without affecting your website speed. The jQuery Feature Preload is recommended to use instead of CDN.</p>
<h3>Static Asset Cache Policy<br>
</h3>
<p>The Static Asset Cache Policy is a Ezoic Leap feature tells the user&#8217;s browser that visited your website once to cache the static assets of your website, which means that if that visitor visited your website again then there will be no need to download those static assets again.</p>

<p>Static assets like images, CSS, js will get cached in the user&#8217;s browser and if the user visits your website again then the browser won&#8217;t need to request the same file again from your website. </p>
<p><strong>Should I use the Static Assets optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>.</p>

<h3>Content Settings<br>
</h3>
<p>The content settings feature in ezoic leap is used for optimizing the iframes and excluding specific scripts, it also has an option that lets you optimize embedded Twitter tweets which cause slowness to websites when used. </p>
<p>															<img width="1024" height="400" src="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-content-settings-1024x400.png.webp" alt="ezoic leap content settings" loading="lazy" srcset="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-content-settings-1024x400.png.webp 1024w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-content-settings-300x117.png.webp 300w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-content-settings-768x300.png.webp 768w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-content-settings.png.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">															</p>
<h4><b>Lazy load Iframes &#8211;</b></h4>
<p> This optimization feature of Ezoic leap Lazy loads iframes that you add into your website, it works just the same as Lazy loading images, the iframes are loaded only when the iframe is in the user&#8217;s view.</p>

<h4><b>Optimize Tweets &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>Just like YouTube embeds, Twitter embeds can also make your website very slow, it causes a lot of render-blocking and downloads a lot of extra files that are not needed for your webpage.</p>
<p>What Optimizes Tweets feature of ezoic does is that it creates a static version of the embedded tweet which means that it will be much faster than the dynamic twitter embed.</p>
<h4><b>Remove Scripts or Styles &#8211; </b></h4>
<p>The remove Scripts or Styles feature of ezoic leap gives us the option to exclude any unused scripts or styles from our website’s frontend, if used properly without breaking your site, this feature can increase your core web vitals ranking by a lot.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Should I use the Content optimization feature of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, use the safe ones like optimize iframes and optimize tweets, the other option that allows us to exclude scripts and styles should be only used by professionals.</p>
<h3>Pre-Connect </h3>
<p>Pre-connect is the last Optimization settings that ezoic leap provides. It is used to tell the user&#8217;s browser to Pre-connect to external resources that a website is going to fetch. It helps a lot if you use external fonts, images, videos or CSS, Html.</p>
<p>															<img width="1024" height="400" src="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-pre-connect-settings-1024x400.png.webp" alt="ezoic leap pre-connect settings" loading="lazy" srcset="https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-pre-connect-settings-1024x400.png.webp 1024w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-pre-connect-settings-300x117.png.webp 300w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-pre-connect-settings-768x300.png.webp 768w,  https://netmiko.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2021/12/ezoic-leap-pre-connect-settings.png.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">															</p>

<p><strong>Should I use the Pre-Connect optimization settings of Leap?</strong> The answer is <em>YES</em>, turn both the pre-connect and pre-connect origin settings on because almost every website uses something that is fetched from an external site.</p>
<p>Okay, so those were the optimization settings that ezoic leap provides to make our website faster and core web vital friendly, now before finishing up the post I would also like to talk about a feature that ezoic leap provides, that feature is Technologies.</p>
<h2>Ezoic Leap Technologies </h2>
<p>The Technologies tab in leap is a recommendation from ezoic on what things you need to fix on your website to make it faster, they will give you the name of the technology you are currently using and its rating.</p>

<p>If you want to use a faster alternative of that technology then on the right side of that technology click on  “View Alternatives” which will provide you with a list of alternatives that are faster than the current technology that you are using.</p>
<p>These recommendations can be very helpful if you want to have a faster website.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now, coming to the conclusion, if your website has ads then there is no way that you can achieve a 100 out of 100 score on PageSpeed Insights because you cannot control the speed of the ad scripts, but you can perform a good enough score if you use Ezoic Leap to optimize your website.</p>

<p>On average the website got almost 69% faster when Ezoic Leap was used. That&#8217;s a lot of improvement if you ask me. That is why I recommend you to use the Ezoic leap settings that I provided and believe me, you won&#8217;t be disappointed. Thank you for Reading&#8230;</p>

<script type="application/ld+json">
			{
				"@context": "http://schema.org/",
				"@type": "BlogPosting",
				"name": "How to use Ezoic Leap for a Faster Website &#038; Page speed",
				"url": "https://netmiko.com/ezoic-leap-for-faster-website/",
				"articleBody": "Having a faster page loading speed is always beneficial, it will help in ranking your blog posts higher, making the user experience better and overall make your blog look more professional. Now, if you have a blog that has ezoic integrated into it then you can get all those benefits on your blog by using a tool by ezoic called Ezoic Leap.		
			What is Ezoic Leap?		
		Ezoic Leap is a website optimization tool by ezoic that helps in optimizing your blog to increase its speed and performance. It has lots of different features that you can use like a content delivery network, image optimization tools, code optimization tools, etc.		
																														
		It also has features that will help you identify the cause of a slow-loading website and will provide you with possible fixes for it. Leap is free for all the ezoic users that have their website monetized using ezoic.		
			Why use Ezoic Leap?
		
		
Do you want your blog to rank higher than the existing blogs on the internet? Then you must use Leap, leap will make your blog perform faster and will make it pass the core web vitals by google, which is now a ranking factor for all the blogs on the internet.Now you must be thinking how would I check whether my blog passes the core web vitals or not? Well, there is a tool by Google called PageSpeed Insights that will help you know how your blog performs.This tool will crawl your blog and check for all the things like Html loading speed, CSS loading speed, image loading speed, etc and will provide you with a score for both mobile and desktop, the scoring system works like this 0-49 (Fail) 50-89 (Acceptable) 90-100 (Good).		
																														
		If your blog falls in the fail or the Acceptable category then it's time that you should start using Ezoic Leap, otherwise, you will have a hard time ranking on google.
			Optimization Settings of Ezoic Leap to Use and Not use		
		Okay, we now know what leap is and why we should use it, so let's now see what are the optimization settings that leap provides for making our website Core Web Vital friendly aka “A fast and optimized website”.		
			CDN & Caching 
		
		Now if you don't know what a CDN is then its basically a group of data centers/servers that that helps in distributing the content of your website at higher speeds to the user, these servers are distributed around the globe which means that these servers will serve the user with the cached content of your website instead of your web server where your website is hosted.So if a user from India requests for a file from your web host that is in the United States then instead of your web host providing the file from the United States server, the Ezoic Leap CDN servers located in India or close to the user that has the file cached with them will provide the user with the requested file.This lowers the latency of your website and makes it faster.
			CSS Optimization		
		Ezoic Leap provides you with four optimization features to optimize the delivery of the CSS files of your website to the user, these optimization features are - Critical CSS, Remove Unused CSS, Optimise Fonts, and Preload Fonts.		
																														
		Critical CSS - This Leap optimization feature helps in loading the required stylesheets that make up the top part of a website that you see whenever you load a webpage, it helps in displaying the top parts of your website as fast as possible.Stylesheets that are required to render the top part of a website are loaded in the &lt;head&gt; of Html to make it render first and prevent any render-blocking.Should I use the Critical CSS optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, it helps in improving the First Contentful Paint.
		Remove Unused CSS - Unused CSS is one thing that almost all websites face whenever running a page speed test using Page Insights, this means that your website is loading CSS stylesheets that are not required for that page, Thus its wasting resources and increasing the time it takes for your website to load.And now this is where the Remove Unused CSS optimization feature by Ezoic Leap comes into play, the Remove Unused CSS feature as the name says, it removes the unused CSS from your website making it load faster and saving resources. Should I use the Remove Unused CSS optimization feature of Leap? The answer is, It Depends. This feature can sometimes break the styling of your website, so after enabling this feature make sure to use multiple devices to check whether your website is functioning properly or not..
		Optimize Fonts - This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap is aimed at optimizing the delivery of the fonts of your website, it helps in making the priority of loading the custom fonts higher, if the custom font takes a lot of time to load then the custom font is replaced by the default font of the user's browser.There is also a sub-option that is called “Allow slow loading fonts”, this feature lazy loads the fonts, which means that the default font of the website is slowly replaced by the custom font that you are using on your website.Should I use the Optimize Fonts feature of Leap? The answer is YES, it's a great feature that helps in improving the CLS (Content Layout Shift) of your website in PageSpeed Insights that is caused by fonts not loading faster. Allow slow loading fonts is not recommended to use.
		Preload Fonts -This is another Ezoic Leap optimization feature aimed at the delivery of fonts that are loaded through external CSS files, it makes the external fonts load faster to avoid any render-blocking from font loading from an external CSS file.Should I use the Preload Fonts optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, most of the websites today use google fonts, which means that these fonts are loaded from an external CSS file and can cause Render blocking if not loaded properly.Render Blocking can drop your Core Web Vital score by a lot, that is why this feature is a must use in Ezoic Leap.The Ezoic Leap CSS optimization features that I use on my website are - Critical CSS, Optimize Fonts, and Preload Fonts.
			Minify 		
		Thousands of lines of code can make your website slow. This is why Ezoic Leaps gives us the feature to lower the size of the website’s CSS, Html, js files of our website aka minify it.		
																														
		What is does it that it removes all the white spaces between the lines of the source codes of our website, the white spaces between the Html, CSS, js files take up a lot of extra space that makes the size of the files bigger, these codes are written to be understood by humans easily that is why they are formatted in an understandable manner.  Ezoic leap removes the white spaces from the source code and makes it easier for browsers to render the website faster. The Ezoic Leap Minify feature has three options that you can turn on - Minify Javascript, Minify CSS, and Minify HTML.
Should I use the Minify optimization features of Leap? The answer is YES. If it doesn't break your website. Try to turn on these features one by one and check your website’s mobile and desktop version to see if it's properly working or not.NOTE: Some common problems that you might face when turning on Minify settings are - CSS not Rendering, Icons not working, Menus not working. Search not working and Features that use javascript not working.		
			Image Optimization 		
		Ezoic Leap has some very helpful optimization features for Optimizing the images on our website, features like Next-gen Formats, Image Resizing, Lazy Loading, Explicit Height and Width, and preload Background images are some nice features to have for optimizing the images on our website. 		
																														
		
		Lazy Load Images - High-quality images on a website can have a huge impact on the loading speed of the webpage if, for example, you have 4 images on your blog post that are 3MB in size, so in total it will be 12MB, now the user's browser will keep loading the page until all the resources have been downloaded which will make the loading speed of your post very slow.This is why we should use the Lazy Load Images feature of ezoic leap that will only load the images that are in the view of the user and not all the images on the blog post.Should I use the Lazy Load Images feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this is a very important feature and is a must-use one.
		Next-Gen Formats - Webp images which are a new type of images designed to be lower in file size than typical jpg, png images, it is supported by almost all the modern browsers.Webp images on average are 40% lower in file size than jpeg, which makes it the most suitable image format for websites, as it takes low bandwidth.The Next-gen Formats optimization feature of ezoic leap will convert the images of your website on the fly and serve it to the users as webp, this will help in making the page load speed faster and if in case the user’s browser doesn't support webp, then ezoic leap will serve them the original image.Should I use the Next-gen Formats optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, google recommends webmasters use this new generation of image format on their blogs.
		Resize Images - This feature of ezoic leap helps in reducing the file size of the images by resizing them based on the user's device, generally, the size of images on a website remains the same on different devices, which means that the high-quality images served to the desktop users of your website are also served to the mobile users.Now mobile users don't need that much high-quality images, which means that your website is just wasting resources and page speed on it, now to fix that you can use the Resize images feature of ezoic leap that will resize the images without the image losing its quality for different devices.Should I use the Resize Images optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this optimization feature helps save a lot of bandwidth and also makes the page load speed faster.
		Preload Background Images -This optimization feature of ezoic leap prevents the large background images on your website from loading until all the stylesheets have finished loading.If you have a huge background image on your website that is very big and loads very slow, then this feature is something that you should use that will stop the loading of the image until all the other stylesheets have been rendered on your website.Should I use the Preload Background Images optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this helps a lot if you have a large background image, as the background image will delay the rendering of stylesheets of your sheets which is not good for core web vitals.
		Set Explicit Width and Height - When running PageSpeed Insights you might sometimes get a warning asking you to set Explicit width and height to the images of your website, this warning means that the images on your website doesn't have any fixed height and width set.This means that the user's browser doesn't know how much space to keep for the image to load which causes a lot of Layout shift as the images displace other elements on your webpage which can affect your core web vitals. Learn more about this here.Should I use the Set Explicit Width and Height optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, CLS can be very frustrating for users as during the page load the elements of your website keep moving here and there causing lots of misclicks, to fix this you must turn this feature ON.
			Script Execution 
		
		Ads scripts are one of the biggest reasons for a slow website, these scripts load very slow causing your website to slow down and perform worse on the core web vitals, this happens because of the external scripts that the ad networks use that are very slow causing render-blocking on your website.Ezoic Leap tries to reduce the impact of scripts on your website with a few sets of tools like - scripts delaying and slowing high CPU usage scripts.		
																														
		
Script Delay - This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap delays the loading and execution of all the JavaScript files in your website and lets the browsers first render the website properly, after that the JavaScript will start loading and executing.With this feature enabled the ads and other features of your website that use JavaScript will work only after the page has rendered properly, this means that the high priority things like text, images will load first and then the low priority things like ads will load after that.Should I use the Script Delay optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, ads and other scripts on your website can make your site’s speed horrible, to reduce the impact of scripts on your website use the script delay feature of Ezoic Leap.
		Reduce CPU Intensive Tasks - This optimization feature of Ezoic Leap also works the same as Scripts delay, it mainly targets the CPU intensive scripts that use a lot of CPU processing power and delay it until all the other things on your website have been rendered.		
		jQuery Loading Method - Okay, so you might have heard of jQuery? It's a JavaScript library that is used to add lots of different features to a website, from animations to menus, it is used a lot in WordPress plugins and that is where the problem comes from. Now the problem with jQuery is that it is very slow. It takes a lot of time to load and can cause render-blocking. Now if you have scripts delayed function enabled then the jQuery files will be delayed until all the other things have been rendered.This works great but can sometimes break the functionality of your website, this is why instead of delaying it you can use the jQuery Loading Method of Ezoic Leap.
The jQuery Loading Method will load a smaller script with the core functionality until all the other things have been rendered, after that it will add the main jQuery file to the queue so that your website won't break and will load the jquery at the end without affecting the speed of your website.You can choose one option from the two in this feature, the first one is to load tiny scripts also called jQuery Feature Preload, or you can just load the entire jQuery using a CDN.Should I use the jQuery Loading Method optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, this is a great feature that helps in loading those slow jquery files without affecting your website speed. The jQuery Feature Preload is recommended to use instead of CDN.
			Static Asset Cache Policy
		
		The Static Asset Cache Policy is a Ezoic Leap feature tells the user's browser that visited your website once to cache the static assets of your website, which means that if that visitor visited your website again then there will be no need to download those static assets again.		
																														
		Static assets like images, CSS, js will get cached in the user's browser and if the user visits your website again then the browser won't need to request the same file again from your website. Should I use the Static Assets optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES.
			Content Settings 
		
		The content settings feature in ezoic leap is used for optimizing the iframes and excluding specific scripts, it also has an option that lets you optimize embedded Twitter tweets which cause slowness to websites when used. 		
																														
		Lazy load Iframes - This optimization feature of Ezoic leap Lazy loads iframes that you add into your website, it works just the same as Lazy loading images, the iframes are loaded only when the iframe is in the user's view.		
		Optimize Tweets - Just like YouTube embeds, Twitter embeds can also make your website very slow, it causes a lot of render-blocking and downloads a lot of extra files that are not needed for your webpage.
What Optimizes Tweets feature of ezoic does is that it creates a static version of the embedded tweet which means that it will be much faster than the dynamic twitter embed.		
		Remove Scripts or Styles - The remove Scripts or Styles feature of ezoic leap gives us the option to exclude any unused scripts or styles from our website’s frontend, if used properly without breaking your site, this feature can increase your core web vitals ranking by a lot.Should I use the Content optimization feature of Leap? The answer is YES, use the safe ones like optimize iframes and optimize tweets, the other option that allows us to exclude scripts and styles should be only used by professionals.
			Pre-Connect 		
		Pre-connect is the last Optimization settings that ezoic leap provides. It is used to tell the user's browser to Pre-connect to external resources that a website is going to fetch. It helps a lot if you use external fonts, images, videos or CSS, Html.		
																														
		Should I use the Pre-Connect optimization settings of Leap? The answer is YES, turn both the pre-connect and pre-connect origin settings on because almost every website uses something that is fetched from an external site.Okay, so those were the optimization settings that ezoic leap provides to make our website faster and core web vital friendly, now before finishing up the post I would also like to talk about a feature that ezoic leap provides, that feature is Technologies.
			Ezoic Leap Technologies 		
		The Technologies tab in leap is a recommendation from ezoic on what things you need to fix on your website to make it faster, they will give you the name of the technology you are currently using and its rating.		
																														
		If you want to use a faster alternative of that technology then on the right side of that technology click on  “View Alternatives” which will provide you with a list of alternatives that are faster than the current technology that you are using.These recommendations can be very helpful if you want to have a faster website.
			Must use Ezoic Leap settings for Faster Page Speed		
		Okay, so here are the Best Ezoic Leap settings that I am using on my blogs and you should too.Critical CSS - Helps improve First Contentful PaintOptimize Fonts - Optimizes Fonts DeliveryPreload Fonts - Preloads External Fonts fasterMinify HTML - Not using CSS,JS as my site breaks down when i use those.All Image optimization settings - Use all of these, if the images don't break.Script Delay - To delay ads script and javascripts for faster rendering of page.Reduce CPU intensive Tasks - To delay CPU intensive scripts.jQuery Loading Method - Loading jQuery from CDN, use Preload if the site doesn't break.Static Asset Cache Policy - Everything turned on.Lazy load iframes - Helps optimize youtube videos and other functions using iframe.Optimize tweets - Helps optimize TweetsPre-connect -Both preconnect option on.Okay so these are the settings that i am using on my blogs along with Ezoic Cache, if something doesn't work for you, like it breaks your website or something then don't use it.
			Conclusion		
		Now, coming to the conclusion, if your website has ads then there is no way that you can achieve a 100 out of 100 score on PageSpeed Insights because you cannot control the speed of the ad scripts, but you can perform a good enough score if you use Ezoic Leap to optimize your website.I did a PageSpeed Insights test of a blog with and without Ezoic Leap activated and here are the results - 		
																														
		On average the website got almost 69% faster when Ezoic Leap was used. That's a lot of improvement if you ask me. That is why I recommend you to use the Ezoic leap settings that I provided and believe me, you won't be disappointed. Thank you for Reading...",
