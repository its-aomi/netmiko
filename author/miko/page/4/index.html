				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can install NLTK ( Natural Language Toolkit ) on your Ubuntu 20.04 using Python. What is NLTK - NLTK is a Python package that provides tools for Natural Language Processing. It provides many different algorithms, which are used to analyze the text and give the answer to questions like sentiment analysis, syntax parsing, part-of-speech tagging, etc.It’s mainly used for linguistic data processing, which means it processes the data to extract the relevant information.Before starting the installation make sure that you have root permissions for your ubuntu system, as we will need root permissions for installing NLTK.		
			Update and Upgrade		
		Okay, so the first step for us will be to update our index packages and also upgrade the downloaded latest packages, you can do that by entering these two commands given below in the terminal.		
			sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade		
		Now to Install NLTK you will need python and pip3 installed on your ubuntu, let’s see how you can install python and pip3 for installing NLTK.		
			Install Python and pip3		
		Now, installing python and pip3 is very easy, to begin first open a terminal window and type the command given below to install python -		
			sudo apt-get install python3		
		To install pip3 you will need to run this command -		
			sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip		
		Now after installing python and pip3, you can start the installation of NLTK on your ubuntu 20.04.		
			Install NLTK
		
		To install NLTK first open a terminal window and in the terminal window type the pip3 command given below which will start the download of NLTK on your ubuntu.		
			sudo pip3 install nltk		
		You might need to enter your password to use the sudo command, after entering your password, the download of nltk will start.Once NLTK finishes downloading, you will need to import NLTK using the import command, you can do that by first entering the following command to open python.		
			python3		
		After entering inside python you will need to use the import command. This will take a little bit of time.		
			import nltk		
		Once the import finishes, the last step will be to download all the nltk packages using the nltk.download command, this will download all the packages you will need for nltk  -		
			nltk.download(&lsquo;all-nltk&rsquo;)
		
			Uninstall NLTK		
		Now, if you want to uninstall NLTK from your ubuntu then you can do that by using pip3, the command format for uninstalling NLTK will be “ pip3 uninstall &lt;package-name&gt; “, where package name will be the name of the library/module that you want to uninstall.		
			pip3 uninstall nltk		
		This command will remove all the files associated with nltk.That was it, that is how you can install NLTK on Ubuntu 20.04 using pip3, Here’s a post that might be of your interest -  Install Anaconda on Ubuntu 20.04If you are facing any problems while installing NLTK on your ubuntu 20.04 then comment below or send me a mail at - netmikoblog@gmail.com.

				"articleBody": "Today I'll walk you through the steps to Install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu 20.04 and Set it up. This will be a Step by Step installation Tutorial for Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu.What is Jupyter Notebook -  Jupyter Notebook is a web-based computing platform and is an open-source project. It is primarily used for data processing, interactive computing projects, and scientific data visualization applications, and for sharing documents with code, visualizations, equations, etc.
			Upgrade and Update
		
		Before you download and install Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to first update the index packages of your ubuntu system and upgrade the system packages using the command - 		
			sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
		
		To Install Jupyter Notebook you'll need root permissions to your ubuntu system, so make sure that you have root permissions.		
			Install Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda
		
		If you have Anaconda installed on your Ubuntu then you can easily install Jupyter Notebook using just one line of command, before that first start anaconda to be able to use the conda command in the terminal. 
If you don't have Anaconda installed then check this post out on Installing Anaconda on Ubuntu 20.04. In that post, I have shown you the full installation tutorial of anaconda.Now once you have started anaconda, open the terminal window and there enter the following command to install Jupyter Notebook. 		
			conda install -c conda-forge notebook
		
		After Jupyter Notebook finishes installing, you can run it using the command - 		
			jupyter notebook
		
		Now, if you don't have Anaconda installed then you can download the Jupyter Notebook using Pip3. 
			Install Jupyter Notebook without Anaconda 		
		To install Jupyter Notebook without Anaconda you will have to first install python3, ipython3 and pip3.		
			Install Python3, iPython, Pip3
		
		First, open your terminal and in the terminal type the command given below to install Python3 -		
			sudo apt-get install python3
		
		After that install ipython3 using this command - 		
			sudo apt-get install ipython3		
		After that install pip3 using the command  - 		
			sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip		
		
After all these packages are installed in your ubuntu, update your index packages once again by using the command -		
			sudo apt-get update
		
			Install Jupyter Notebook
		
		Now after installing all the required packages you can now install the Jupyter notebook. To Install Jupyter, first go into root using the command - 		
			sudo su		
		After that use the command given below to install Jupyter Notebook using pip3.		
			pip3 install jupyter
		
		It will take some time for the jupyter notebook to finish installing, once it is installed exit root by typing \"exit\" in terminal. After that you can run the jupyter notebook using the command -		
			exit		
			jupyter notebook --allow-root		
		After the first startup and shutdown of Jupyter Notebook, you can use the command \"jupyter notebook\" to run Jupyter in new terminal windows.
			Open Jupyter Notebook Dashboard
		
		After typing the command to run jupyter, you will see an output in the terminal window where you entered the command, the output will give you a URL address that you will need to copy and open in your web browser to access the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.		
																														
		This URL will have a token with it for the first time login, after that you can access Jupyter Notebook by going to the default address of Jupyter Notebook which is “http://localhost:8888”.		
			Change Jupyter Notebook port		
		Okay, so after you have installed Jupyter notebook, if you don't want to run Jupyter Notebook on its default web address at http:localhost:8888 then you can change it using the command - 		
			jupyter notebook --port port_number
		
		
		Here in place of “port_number” use the port number that you want the Jupyter Notebook to use, like “http:localhost:9999”, or something else. Before entering this command in the terminal first close Jupyter Notebook using \"CTRL + C\", enter y then press enter.		
			Fix Permission Denied when opening Jupyter Notebook 
		
		Now after installing Jupyter Notebook if you are facing any error like “Permission Denied” when trying to open jupyter notebook or when trying to create a new notebook then here's how you can fix it. Open your terminal and type the following commands -		
			sudo jupyter notebook --allow-root
sudo chmod -R 700 .local
		
		
		This will fix the Permission denied problem, alternatively, you can also create a dedicated folder for Jupyter Notebook by using the following commands - 		
			mkdir folder_name
jupyter-notebook --notebook-dir folder_name
		
		This will change the directory that Jupyter uses by default to the one that you created and selected. If you use this method then you will have no problem with permissions. 		
			Fix Jupyter Notebook not Opening		
		If your Jupyter Notebook is not opening then it's probably happening due to corrupt files, to fix the problem all you will need to do is uninstall the Jupyter Notebook and all related files to it from your ubuntu system.
After that install it again and this time Jupyter Notebook should work fine. Use the command “conda uninstall pyzmq” to remove all jupyter related packages and after that reinstall all the Jupyter packages using “conda install pyzmq”.And that’s it, that's how you can install Jupyter Notebook on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.

				"articleBody": "Today I'll walk you through some simple steps that you can take on your ezoic approved website to get the highest possible epmv. This means you can earn more revenue with less traffic. Okay, let's see the things that you need to change on your website if you want higher epmv (earnings per mile visitors).
			1. Place More Placeholders 
		
		Placeholders are potential ad locations where ezoic might or might not display an ad. That is why it's best to place as many placeholders as you can for the ezoic ai to do the testing. When you place more placeholders on your website, the Ezoic AI gets to test more combinations of ad display, which means that after a few weeks of testing you get more revenue as the ezoic ai now knows the best places to display an ad for high conversion. This will also help in increasing your EPMV as the more you earn, the more premium networks will display their high epmv ads on your website. If you want to know how you can place ezoic placeholders on your WordPress website then check this post out - How to place Ezoic Placeholders on a WordPress Website.
			2. Write Longer Posts
		
		So the reason why you should write longer posts is because, firstly the longer your posts are the higher the chance of that post to rank in organic search, which means that you will get high-quality traffic from the web, the better the quality of traffic = more the epmv.Another reason why you should write longer posts is that in a long blog post you can add more placeholders, which means more ads will be displayed and you will earn more revenue. But do remember that you should not try to stretch a blog post and just make the blog post longer, always write something that will help the visitor and not something that is just there to make the post longer.
			3. Get Traffic from Top Tier Countries		
		Now, this is probably the most important thing that your site needs, always try to get traffic from top-tier countries like the United States, Japan, United kingdom, etc, if you want to have higher epmv.		
																														
		Because generally, the traffic you get from these countries has very high epmv compared to low tier countries like India, Philippines, etc. This is the reason that most of the people that do keyword research tend to look at the search difficulty in the United States, because if they can rank in these top-tier countries then they will earn more revenue.And, also try to get more traffic from google instead of getting it from social media and youtube, because the traffic you get from google organic is higher in quality than the traffic that you get from social media.
			4. Use High Quality keywords		
		Writing blog posts that contain high-quality keywords is very important when you want to have a higher epmv, that is because keywords that have more search volume and advertisements will earn you more revenue.For example, “web hosting” is a keyword that is searched a lot on the web, which also means that there are lots of companies that have placed ads on this keyword, thus increasing the competition and increasing the epmv for this keyword.		
																														
		So, if you write blog posts with high-quality keywords, then ezoic will display more paying ads on your website which will increase your epmv. 
Now one thing to take note of is that you should never write blog posts on keywords that are too competitive, as you will never rank on google with that, instead try to write on long-tail keywords with medium to low competition keywords.		
			5. Get Traffic from Social Media		
		Now as I said before in this blog post, that “social media traffic is low quality”, now that is true, but the thing is that for a blog post to rank on google it needs a little bit of push from outside traffic.This means that you should try to get some traffic from social media to your new blog posts so that they can rank better on google search, which of course in return will provide you with high-quality traffic from google once it ranks. 
			6. Place Floating Placeholders
		
		Floating placeholders also called sticky sidebar ad are ezoic placeholders that stay in a fixed place even when you scroll the page. 		
																														
		This placeholder is mostly placed in the sidebar of a website where when a user scrolls down they will always see the floating ad on the sidebar. This placeholder can earn you a lot of revenue on the desktop version of your website.As this placeholder is always displaying an ad to your visitor, this will increase the chances of you getting more premium high epmv ads showing on that floating placeholder. You should only use this placeholder on the sidebar of your desktop, don't use it on the mobile version of your site, as it will ruin the user experience.
NOTE: If you want to use Sticky sidebar ad then enable it in Ad tester settings in ezoic. After that place the sticky ad placeholder.		
			7. Change Ezoic Settings		
		There are some settings that you should change in your ezoic dashboard which can increase the epmv that you get on your website.Enable Vignette Ads - Vignette Ads are full-screen ads that are displayed during page load. You can enable Vignette Ads by going to the Monetization tab, there scroll down, and in “Ad tester” click on general settings.Here enable both Vignette Ads for Mobile and Vignette Ads for Tablet and click on save.
Enable NATIVE AD UNITS - Go to the Monetization tab and scroll down, here look for NATIVE AD UNITS and turn it on.Native ad units are sponsored content that will appear at the bottom of your blog post, these are ads of blog posts on other websites that are related to the blog post you have written.		
																														
		Turn on Ezoic - First go to the settings tab of ezoic, here in “Turn on Ezoic” click on the “update settings” button and make everything 100%, this will send all the traffic you receive through ezoic, this will help in increasing your epmv.Change Optimisation Goals - Go to settings, here scroll down, and in optimization goals select balanced or revenue-focused. If you select revenue-focused then ezoic will try to show the user the best variation of ads that will earn you more.		
																														
		
		However, if you select revenue-focused, your site might look a little bit spammy due to too many ads in the test phase of the ezoic ai. Okay, so these were the settings that you need to enable on your ezoic website to get a little bit higher epmv.		
			8. Add more Images		
		Adding more images to your website helps in making the post longer in (px) which means that you can add more placeholders and ads. Adding images also improves user experiences and helps increase the time that a user spends on your website, due to which you earn more revenue and also get higher epmv ads from advertisers, as they think that your website has some value to show their ads.
			9. Increase Font Size		
		Increasing the font size of your website works the same as images, when you increase the font size of your website, the length of the post becomes longer and it also makes it easier for users to read what is written properly.The optimal font size that you should use from higher epmv will be between 17 - 23px, you should not make the font size more than that as it will make the user experience bad, which will hurt your epmv instead of making it higher.		
			10. Enable Mediation App
		
		If you have AdSense, media.net, like ad networks approved on your website then you must enable the mediation app, mediation app can increase your epmv by a lot.
What the mediation app does is that it makes ezoic compete with other ad networks for placing ads on your website, which means that for a single ad space both will place their bids, and the one who places the higher bids gets to display their ads on that ad space.So, the more competition between the ad networks, the more epmv you will get. This is why you must enable the mediation app if you are approved in other ad networks.You can enable the mediation app by going to the “Monetization” tab, scrolling down a little and you will get the mediation option.		
																														
		Do note that if instead of ezoic winning the bid any other ad network does then you will be paid by the other ad network and not in ezoic, like if AdSense won the bid then the money you get will be in your AdSense account and not ezoic.
			11. Enable LEAP		
		Leap is a toolset by ezoic that helps you in optimizing your website's speed and performance. With the help of leap, you can do many things like minifying static assets, optimizing images, optimizing scripts, etc.		
																														
		This helps in making your website faster, which means that your website will rank higher on google search which will bring high-quality traffic to your website and this also helps in making the ads load faster which means that you will not miss out on any revenue.You can enable or change leap settings by going to the “Speed” tab and clicking on “Optimisation settings” to change the settings of the Leap app.With the higher loading speed of your website, you will get a higher EPMV.
			12. Increase User Experience		
		User experience is everything in the world of blogging, do you have a fast, smooth, easy-to-navigate, not spammy website? Because if your website is not fast, smooth, easy to navigate, and is very spammy, then chances are that the visitors that visit your website will leave your site after reading it for a few seconds, which will send a signal to Google that your website is not good as the user is not staying there for a longer time.This will ultimately hurt your SEO and will lower your website rank, also due to low time on the page, you will get very low epmv. That is why the user experience is very important if you want higher EPMV on all of your blog posts.
Make the user experience on your website better by making the font size and look better, adding high-quality photos, adding proper headings, and increasing the speed of your website. One more thing that you can add to your blog posts to make them better is adding videos, videos are a great way to explain a complicated thing that you cannot explain by text, so try to add videos to your blog posts, it will also help in increasing the time a user spends on your website.		
			13. Make Loyal Audience
		
		So what is the connection between a Loyal Audience and Higher EPMV?? Well, it's all about “TRUST”.If you have a loyal audience then the chances of them clicking on the ads shown on your website are higher, as people trust your website so they will also trust everything displayed on your website.
Now if you are getting a lot of clicks on your ads then the ezoic epmv will also increase as advertisers will compete with higher bids to place ads on your website as the conversion rate is very high on your website. NOTE: Never ask your audience to click on ads. This will count as invalid clicks and it is also against ezoic policy, your account will get terminated if you ask users to click on the ads on your website in any way.		
			14. Write on Trending Topics
		
		Writing on trending topics can be very beneficial for your website, trending topics can provide you with a lot of traffic which in turn will increase your revenue.If the trending topic is of a high-quality keyword then you will have more epmv. Overall it's a good thing to write blog posts on trending topics.
			Conclusion - 
		
		Everybody wants a higher epmv on their website because with higher epmv you can earn more revenue with little traffic. You will have to work a lot harder and smarter if you want to have a higher ezoic epmv.Just make sure that you keep the user experience good, your website loading speed fast, and do proper keyword research. Try to get traffic from search instead of getting traffic from social media and try to build a loyal audience.Keep writing high-quality blog posts regularly and keep the website updated, make people trust your website and you will start earning more. And that is how you will be able to Increase Ezoic EPMV easily.",

				"name": "How to place Ezoic Placeholders on a WordPress Site | 4 Easy Methods",
				"url": "https://netmiko.com/place-ezoic-placeholders-wordpress/",
				"articleBody": "Today I'll talk about 4 Easy methods which you can use to place Ezoic Placeholders on your WordPress website. If you want to know how you can place ezoic ads on your WordPress website without any hassle then you have come to the right place.Now before we see the methods, let's see what ezoic placeholders are and why placing them in the right place is important.
			What are Ezoic Placeholders?
		
		According to Ezoic, Placeholders are “potential ad locations” where ezoic may or may not display an ad depending upon the user. Whether to place ads or not in these placeholders is decided by Ezoic AI for the best user experience and revenue.That is why it's best to place as many placeholders as you can on your website, this will at first look like spam but once the AI learns more about your site, the site earnings will increase, and also the user experience will get better. Now that we know what ezoic placeholders are, let's see how we can add ezoic placeholders to our WordPress website.
			1. Using Ezoic Browser Extension 
		
		Okay so using the Ezoic Browser Extension to add Ads placeholders is the recommended method according to Ezoic, as it is easy to do and does not require any change on the backend of your website, but this method is something that I don't recommend. Before you know why let's see how you can use the ezoic browser extension to place ezoic placeholders.https://youtu.be/Zd1pmweBQhk		
		1. First go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/ezoic. Click on ezoic and then click on “Add to Chrome”. Ezoic extension is not available on firefox.
2. After adding the Ezoic extension to your chrome browser, go to your website URL, first make sure to log out of your website because the extension won't work if you are logged in to your website admin.3. Now once you are logged out, click on extensions then click on the ezoic extension. This will open the extension. 4. Now to be able to add an ezoic placeholder on your website you will need to click on the “Create” tab. Then click on “ Select Location”. 
5. This will start the edit mode where using your mouse you can add ezoic placeholders anywhere you like. 6. Click any place where you want to add a placeholder, this will add a placeholder space there, click on “insert here” to add a placeholder. Select any custom ad size or keep it to default then click “Save changes” or click the “red x” to cancel. 7. Click on “Turn off Edit Mode” to save the changes.		
			Why don't I recommend using the Ezoic extension to place ads placeholders?
		
		
		The reason why I don't recommend you to use the Ezoic browser extensions is that it requires a lot of work and time for setting up placeholders on your WordPress website using the ezoic extension.When you place one placeholder in one of your website posts, the ezoic ai starts placing placeholders on other posts of your website automatically. Now you might be thinking that it's a great feature. Believe me, it's not, the placeholders placed by the ai are very random in some cases, which means they will show ads in places where you should not place ads, thus making the user experience bad.
Also one of the biggest problems with using the ezoic extension to place placeholders is that whenever you change the appearance of your website, like you changed the sidebar position, added something, then there’s a very high chance that the placeholders placed on your sidebars and other parts of the site like header and footer will disappear.So if you see a drop in revenue, then it's probably because some placeholders of your website disappeared. This used to happen a lot on my website, because of which I stopped using the ezoic extension.		
			2. Using Ad Inserter Plugin 
		
		Now, if you want an easy method to place ezoic placeholders that are very customizable then you can use an ad manager plugin called “Ad Inserter – Ad Manager &amp; AdSense Ads”. 
This plugin allows you to add Html ad codes to your WordPress website in the frontend and it is highly customizable.To Set it up, first, login to your WordPress admin dashboard and go to Plugins &gt; Add new. Search for “Ad Inserter – Ad Manager &amp; AdSense Ads”, install and activate the plugin.After activating the plugin you can access it by going to Settings &gt; Ad inserter. 		
																														
		In the plugin, you will have 16 code blocks, where you can place your ad codes. You can place your ad codes in these blocks and select where you would like them to display on your website. 
You can select the location, page, category, tags, etc, where you want to display the ad. There are tons of customization options in this plugin that will help you a lot in managing your ezoic placeholders.Like if you want your ezoic placeholder to show after three paragraphs then just copy your ezoic placeholder code and paste it in the first code block, scroll down and in “Insertion” select “After paragraph” on the right side of it, select the number of paragraphs after which you want to ad code to appear and click on save changes.		
																														
		Just like this if you want to add another placeholder then copy the placeholder code and paste it into the 2nd code block of the plugin. Select after paragraph in “insertion” and where you want the placeholder to appear after the 1st ad code.
Now, this plugin is great but the problem with this plugin is that it has limited ad blocks where you can place your ezoic placeholder code. This means that if you are writing longer posts and have lots of different variations of placeholders then this plugin will not be sufficient.		
			3. Manually using html blocks		
		Now, this is a straightforward method to add ezoic placeholders to your WordPress site. First, log in to your Ezoic dashboard and go to “Monetization Tab”, here in the monetization tab scroll down a little and click on the “NEW PLACEHOLDER” button. Select the placeholder location from the dropdown, like if you want to use it at the top of your sidebar then select “Sidebar Top”, name the placeholder and click on “SAVE” to create the placeholder.		
																														
		
		After creating the placeholder click on the bracket at the right side of the ezoic placeholder. This will display the ezoic placeholder ad code that you will need to copy. 		
																														
		Now log in to your WordPress website admin panel and go to “Appearance &gt; Widgets” here in the widget's settings drag and drop a “Custom Html” widget to the sidebar and paste the ezoic ad code there and click save. Ezoic will now display an ad in the place where you added the placeholder.   		
																														
		Similarly, if you want to add the ezoic placeholder in your blog posts then all you need to do is create multiple new placeholders (use one placeholder only one time in a single post). After that in the WordPress editor, search for the Html block and click on it, now paste the ezoic placeholder code in it.
I recommend placing ezoic placeholders after “every three to five paragraphs” like, place one at the start of the post, after five paragraphs place one again and repeat the process.		
			4. Using Shortcode plugin 
		
		Using a Shortcode plugin is the recommended method to place Ezoic placeholders on your WordPress website because it's easy to use and you can easily manage your placeholders through the shortcode plugin.I am also using a shortcode plugin to place ezoic placeholders on my website. The plugin that I am using is called “Shortcoder”. You can download the plugin from here, Or you can search for it.
After installing and activating the plugin, go to Shortcoder &gt; Create Shortcode. Here name your shortcode, paste the ezoic placeholder code at the bottom and click on publish. Just like this, create all the shortcodes that you need.		
																														
		After creating the shortcodes you can see all the shortcodes by going to Shortcoder &gt; All Shortcode. Copy the shortcode of the ezoic placeholder that you want to add to your blog post.Now in the editor click on the plus icon and search for shortcode, here select “shortcode” and not “shortcoder”. After that in the shortcode block paste the shortcode that you copied from the shortcoder plugin.		
																														
		That's how you can use the shortcode plugin to add ezoic placeholders on your WordPress website.
The plus point of using a shortcode plugin instead of using an ad manager plugin is that the shortcoder plugin is lightweight, you can create unlimited shortcodes, its easy to switch from ezoic to other ad networks because all you need to do is remove the ezoic ad code and place any other ad code by editing the shortcode.This is the method that I use and also recommend you to use for your WordPress website.And that is how you can place ezoic placeholders on your WordPress website using ezoic browser extension, ad inserter plugin, Html blocks, and shortcoder plugin.

				"articleBody": "Today I'll walk you through the steps to Install Tableau Server on Ubuntu 18.04. You can easily install a Tableau server on your ubuntu device after following this tutorial. Now before we see the installation process of tableau server, let's see what tableau is.Tableau Server - is a web-based data analysis tool that allows for the analysis of data in a wide variety of formats. It also enables users to create interactive dashboards that can be published on the internet.
			Download Tableau Server
		
		Okay, so the first step is to download the tableau server. You can download Tableau using the terminal or directly from the official website. I'll first show you how you can download tableau using the terminal -		
			Download Tableau Server using terminal  
		
		We will use wget to download tableau, so make sure you have wget installed on your ubuntu. You can check whether you have wget installed on your ubuntu or not by using this command -		
			wget --version		
		After entering the above command you will get an output in the terminal which will say something like “ GNU wget 1.20.3 built on linux-gnu “ this means that wget is installed, if it says command not found then it means wget is not installed on your ubuntu.
You can install wget on your ubuntu 18.04 by using the command -		
			sudo apt-get install wget		
		After installing wget, change your working directory to home using the command “cd ~” after that enter the command given below in the terminal which will start the download of Tableau server deb file.		
			wget https://downloads.tableau.com/tssoftware/tableau-server-2021-3-4_amd64.deb 
		
		The size of the Tableau server is 2.5GB, so it will take some time to finish downloading depending upon your internet connection.Get the latest version of Tableau Server from here.
			Download Tableau Server using Web Browser 		
		To download tableau server using your web browser, first, open your web browser and paste this link in the web browser - https://www.tableau.com/downloads/server/deb This is the direct download link for Tableau Server. After downloading the Tableau server deb file, move the downloaded file from the Downloads folder to the home directory, as by default anything you download using the browser will be downloaded to the downloads directory.After moving the file start the Tableau Services Manager to install the tableau server.
			Start Tableau Services Manager
		
		After downloading the Tableau server, in your terminal type the following commands to first update the index packages.		
			sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
		
		After that, we will need to install GDebi-core which we use for installing local deb packages. You can install gdebi-core by entering this command in the terminal - 		
			sudo apt-get -y install gdebi-core		
		After gdebi-core finishes downloading and installing, use gdebi to install the downloaded Tableau server deb file. The format for this will be - \"sudo gdebi -n downloaded-file-name\"For us, it will be this one - 		
			sudo gdebi -n tableau-server-2021-3-4_amd64.deb 
		
		
		Wait for it to finish installing the tableau deb file, it will take some time. Now to start the Tableau Services Manager we’ll have to run the “./initialize-tsm” file located at the path “/opt/tableau/tableau_server/packages/scripts_version/initialize-tsm”.After the installation of the tableau deb file, at the end of the installation, you will get an output in the terminal that will give you the command that you will need to enter for a single node or initial node installation. It will be in this format - “sudo /opt/tableau/tableau_server/packages/scripts_version/initialize-tsm --accepteula”.		
																														
		Copy the command shown in the terminal and enter it.
Once this finishes you can now use the web installer to finish the installation process of Tableau server.Connect to the web interface of Tableau server by going to http://your-server-ip:8850 or if you want to run it locally then its http://tableau:8850 or http://localhost:8850 		
			Login, Register and Setup Tableau Server
		
		After going to the web address of the Tableau server, you will be asked to first log in. Log in using your username and your password. After logging in you will be on the Activation page of Tableau, here if you have a product key then enter it. If you don't, then at the bottom you will get the option to try Tableau for free for 14 days. Click on “Start Tableau Server Trial” to continue.
After that, you will be on the Register page where you will need to enter all the information that is asked there, and after that click on Register.Now here on the Setup page, select the identity store. I have selected “local” here. After that click on Initialize to Start the Initialization process of the Tableau server. Now the Initialization will take some time to finish like 10 min or something.After initialization finishes, you will be asked to create a Tableau server Administrator Account. To do that open your terminal and paste the command given below - 		
			tabcmd initialuser --server 'localhost:80' --username 'your_username_here' 
		
		Add a username of your choice and log in to your Tableau server using this username.

			FAQ - 		
			Is Tableau server supported on Ubuntu 20.04 ?
		
		No, currently Tableau server is not supported on ubuntu 20.04. However, the developers of tableau have said that they are working on making tableau server supported on other versions of ubuntu. They said that 2 years ago, so I don't think the Tableau server for ubuntu 20.04 is coming anytime soon.",
