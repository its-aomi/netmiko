				"articleBody": "In this post, I will walk you through the steps of how to host a WordPress website on GitHub with a custom domain.We will be going over how to create a WordPress website using GitHub Pages and linking it to a custom domain. And also adding search and comment features to our site.Here are the Steps to Host a WordPress Website on GitHub with Custom domain:Install XAMPPInstall WordPress on LocalHostSign up for GitHub and make a RepositoryAdd repository to GitHub PagesAdd Custom DomainInstall GitHub Desktop and clone RepositoryCreate Static WordPress files and push to GitHub RepositoryAdd a custom 404 pageAdd Disqus CommentsAdd Google Search All these steps will be shown to you in detail so make sure to read the article to the end.There are numerous advantages to hosting your website on GitHub Pages. GitHub pages host the site for free, make it easy to manage, and is also very easy to set up.Hosting your website on GitHub pages is also much faster than traditional hosting methods. Now when you are hosting a WordPress website on GitHub, the dynamic content of your website like the search bar, comment section won't work. As the website will be static and not dynamic.To fix that we will be using google search and Disqus comments on our website that will help us add those functionalities to our WordPress website.Now, the first thing we will do is to install and set up a WordPress site on our local host that we will then connect to our GitHub and publish our website on the internet.		
					
			Install WordPress on Local Host -
		
		So, here’s how it will work. First we will install WordPress on our local host, then we will create static files of our WordPress files using a plugin and then we will push those files to the GitHub repository which will then publish the files to the internet.Now to install WordPress on your local host we will have to first download XAMPP. You can download XAMPP by going to this link here.1. Here click on your operating system. After that XAMPP will be downloaded. After downloading, install XAMPP. 		
																														
		2. Open XAMPP and then start Apache and MySQL. You can now access your local host by typing localhost/ in your web browser.		
																														
		Now to install WordPress in our local host we will first have to download the WordPress zip file from wordpress.org. I am using windows, if you use some other operating system then the steps will be the same. The ways to do them might be a little different.1. Go to https://wordpress.org/download/ . Scroll down a little and there you will get the download button. Click on it to download WordPress. You can also download the old versions of WordPress from https://wordpress.org/download/releases/		
																														
		2. After Downloading the zip file, “right click” on it. Then click on the “Extract To” option. Wait for it to finish extracting.		
																														
		3. Now go inside the extracted folder of WordPress. And copy all the files present there.		
																														
		4. After that go to your “C drive”. And Locate “xampp” folder, go inside xampp folder and locate htdocs, go inside htdocs.5. Here inside the htdocs folder, create a new folder called “localsite”. After that paste all the WordPress files that you copied inside the “localsite” folder.		
																														
		6. Now, go to your web browser and type “localhost/phpmyadmin”. Here click on the “Databases”. 		
																														
		7. In the database name type “localsite” and then click on the create button at the right side. After the database has been created, close the tab and go to “localhost/localsite”.		
																														
		In “localhost/localsite” follow WordPress instructions to complete the installation of WordPress on your local host.In database configuration the database name will be “localsite”, Username will be “root”, remove the password and then click on the submit button. Then click “Run installation”.Make sure to remember the password and username of your WordPress admin during the installation process. Now that our WordPress website has been set up properly on our local host, let's create a GitHub repository to host our website files.		
			Sign up for GitHub and Create a Repository - 		
		All our website files will be hosted on GitHub. And we will be using GitHub pages for setting the site live.To create a GitHub repository first we will have to create a GitHub account. To create a GitHub account go to https://github.com. Here click on the sign-up button on the top right.Enter your email address, a secure password, username and then solve the captcha and create your GitHub account. Verify your email by the code sent to your email address and then follow GitHub's instructions to complete the account setup.		
																														
		Once your account setup is complete, follow the steps below to create a GitHub repository to host your website files.1. Once you are in your GitHub Dashboard Click on the “NEW” button at the top left. You might also see the “Create Repository” option if you have logged in for the first time to your GitHub account.
																														
		2. Now here you'll need to enter your repository name. I recommend you name it the same as your domain name. The repository should be public and not private. Scroll down a little and tick the “add a README file”. After that click on the “Create Repository”.		
																														
		Your repository will be now created. After creating the GitHub repository we will have to now add our GitHub repository to GitHub pages.		
			Add the Repository to GitHub Pages -
		
		To add our repository to GitHub Pages we will have to create a new branch and delete the default main branch.
1. Once you are inside your GitHub Repository click on the “MAIN” button and then in the “Find or create a branch” type gh-pages and then click on the Create branch.		
																														
		2. Now we will need to delete the main branch and make the gh-pages branch the default branch. To do that first go to settings, then to Branches.Here click on the “arrow button” and then click on the “main” button. Select gh-pages and then click on Update. After that click on the “I understand, update the default branch”. 
																														
		Now to delete the “main” branch go back to your repository and click on “Branches”, here in branches click on the delete icon on the main branch, after that go back to &lt;&gt; Code.		
																														
		You can now access your site at \"your-username.github.io/repository-name\"Now to make it look better, easier to read and share let's add a Custom Domain to it.		
			Add Custom Domain to GitHub Pages site -		
		To add a custom domain to your GitHub pages site, first, go to your domain registrar from where you bought the domain name. And then go to the DNS settings.In case you don't have a domain name then you can get a domain name for free using freenom.com, which provides you with free ccTLD domain.I am using Cloudflare so I will use Cloudflare DNS settings. Depending upon what domain name provider you use the DNS settings will be found in different places. Google it.Once you are in the DNS settings, here you will need to add four “A” records pointing to GitHub.1. To do that first select “A” record, in the “name” type your domain name. After that add these IP addresses -  185.199.108.153 -    185.199.109.153 -  185.199.110.153  -  185.199.111.153 		
																														
		2. Add all the four A records and after that wait a few minutes for the DNS to Propagate.		
																														
		If you want the www version of your site to redirect to a non-www version then also add a “CNAME” record. Where in Name it will be “www” and in content it will be your domain name.After 10 mins go back to your GitHub repository and then go to settings. In settings scroll down and look for “Pages”.Click “Pages”. Now here in Pages scroll down and in “Custom Domain” add your domain name and then click on Save.		
																														
		Your Website can now be accessed through the custom domain name.		
			Install GitHub Desktop and Clone Repository -
		
		Now we will install GitHub Desktop and clone our website repository in it. Using GitHub desktop will make it easy to push our website files to our repository.First, go to https://desktop.github.com Download the GitHub exe file to your Desktop and then install it. Make sure to remember the installation path.Once GitHub is installed, Open it. And then sign in to GitHub using your email and password.After signing in to GitHub, go to “File” at the top left corner or Press CTRL+SHIFT+O to clone a repository.		
																														
		Select the repository that we made for our website and then click on “clone”. Remember the Local Folder path displayed at the bottom. We’ll need that.  		
																														
		Wait for the cloning to finish, after the cloning finishes minimize the GitHub Desktop.		
			Create Static WordPress files and push to GitHub Repository - 
		
		As you know that in GitHub we can't host dynamic websites, websites that need a database won't work in GitHub pages. The only important dynamic part of a blog is search and comments which we will add using Disqus and google search.All the other parts of a WordPress site can work easily without a database. To be able to host our WordPress site on GitHub pages we will convert our WordPress files into static files using the “Simply Static” Plugin.First, open XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL. After that log in to your WordPress site hosted on localhost. You can log in to WordPress by going to “localhost/wordpress_folder_name/wp-admin/.Follow these steps here for installing WordPress on localhost.After Logging in to your admin dashboard go to Plugins&gt;Add New. Here search for a plugin called “Simply Static”. Install and activate the plugin.		
																														
		Once the plugin is activated go to Simply Static &gt; Settings from the admin menu on the left.		
																														
		Here, in the Destination URL select “Use absolute URLs, change HTTP to HTTPS and add your domain name. Scroll down a little and in the Delivery Method select “Local directory”.		
																														
		After that, we will have to add the path to our local directory where these static files will be stored. The path will be where our GitHub repository was cloned. Remember the path that was showing below when cloning the repository.		
																														
		Paste that file path in simply static settings and then click on Save Changes.You can easily find the file path by opening GitHub Desktop and clicking “Show in Explorer”. After that copy the file path from the file explorer and paste it into Simply Static settings.STEP 1 - Once settings are saved go to Simply Static&gt; Generate and here click on the generate button. Wait for it to finish.		
																														
		STEP 2 - When it says “Done, Finished” go back to your GitHub Desktop, and here you will see a lot of files automatically appeared here. All you need to do now is give a summary on the bottom left. And then click on “Commit to gh-pages”.		
																														
		STEP 3 - After clicking commit, on the top bar click on the “Push Origin”. Your website files will be now uploaded to your GitHub repository. When \"push origin\" changes to \"Fetch origin\" then it means the files were uploaded to your GitHub repository		
																														
		Your WordPress website is now live and you can access it by typing your domain name. It might take a few minutes for the changes to appear.Note: Every time you change something on your website like adding a post or something else and want to publish it, just follow the three steps shown above.		
			Adding a Custom 404 Page -
		
		Now by default, there is a GitHub 404 page that is not so good. So to fix that we will add a custom 404 page to our site.To do that go inside your repository and here click on “Add File” and then Create a new file.		
																														
		Now in name, you'll have to name it “404.md”, you cannot name it anything else. After naming it, copy the code from below and paste it into the editor. You can also add your code here or make any changes.		
			&lt;html lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
	&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;404.. Page not Found. Return to HOME&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
		
																														
		After adding the code scroll down and click on “Commit new File”. Your website will now have a custom 404 page that you can test by going to any URL that doesn't exist on your website.		
			Adding Disqus Comments to Static WordPress site -
		
		As our WordPress website is a static site, the default comment box won't work as it needs a database to work. So, to be able to add a comment feature to our static site we will use Disqus Comments.Disqus will help us in adding the comments feature to our website.
To start, first, go to https://disqus.com/profile/signup/  and sign up using email or any other ways available. Then select “I want to install Disqus on my site”.Now here in “Create a new site”, Enter your domain name and select the category of your site and then click on Create Site. After that select your Disqus Plan. 		
																														
		Now after selecting the plan close the tab and go to https://disqus.com/admin and click on Settings on the top bar. Click on your domain name. After clicking on your domain name you will be in the admin dashboard of your Disqus site.
Here copy the ShortName. Which you can get in Settings&gt;General.		
																														
		After copying the ShortName Go back to your WordPress Admin. Now go to Plugins&gt;Add New and search for “pipDisqus”. Install the “pipDisqus – Lightweight Disqus Comments” plugin and activate it.After activating the plugin you can access the plugin by going to Settings&gt;pipDisqus.Here in Disqus ShortName add the ShortName that we copied from Disqus Admin and then click on Save Changes.
																														
		That's it, the default WordPress comment box will be replaced with Disqus comments which will work on your static WordPress site.Publish the changes after that.		
			Adding Google Search to Static WordPress site -
		
		Now, this is an optional step, to add a search bar to your static website. You can add one or just live without it. Small sites don't need a search bar anyways.
But if you want to add one then you can follow the steps below. First, go to https://cse.google.com/cse/ and click on Get Started. Sign In with your Google account.After that in “Sites to search” enter your domain name. And in Search Engine enter google. Solve the captcha and click on Create.After that click on “Get Code” and copy the script that is shown on the screen. Paste this script in any place on your site where you want the search bar to show.
You can go to https://cse.google.com/cse/ to change how your search bar looks.		
			Wrapping it Up -
		
		And that's it, that's how you can host a WordPress website on GitHub with a custom domain and with Disqus comments and also a search bar. All the features of a dynamic website in a static website.You can access the site that we used in this tutorial at aomie.tk, do check it out.
Finally, all I want to say is that this post took me three days to finish, so, show some love and comment below. Thank You.

				"@context": "http://schema.org/",
				"@type": "BlogPosting",
				"name": "How to use External images in WordPress without Import",
				"url": "https://netmiko.com/external-image-without-import-wordpress/",
				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can use external images on your WordPress site without import. NOTE: Skip to \"Adding external image\" if you already have your image link and just want to add it to your WordPress site.Don't skip if you want to know how you can host your website images.
			Why offload images -		
		Images are One of the most important parts of a blog because without images our blog won't look beautiful and won't attract users. Which will lower engagement on our site and also lower our rankings.That's why adding at least three images to a blog post is recommended. Now when it comes to images the problem with images is that images are bulky and take up a lot of bandwidth and storage. Which is something that can cost you a lot of money and also increase the loading time of your website.
That is something that nobody wants. Now to fix that problem what we can do is offload the images, meaning that serving the images from a external server instead of where our website is hosted.Hosting our images in a different place will save us a lot of bandwidth and will also make our website faster and decrease the image loading speed.		
			Where to host website images for offloading -
		
		To offload the images of our site we will have to first choose a reliable place to host our images. There are lots of different image hosting services out there that you can use. 
But those will cost us a lot of money to use. Now If your website is very big then you will have to use paid image hosting.But if it's not and uses less than 20 GB of bandwidth per day then you can use Dropbox for hosting your images. Dropbox gives us 2GB of storage space on a free account which you can increase by buying their paid plan which is very cheap.Now let us see how we can add these images hosted externally to our WordPress site without importing them.
			Hosting image on external server and  getting the link -		
		You can use any image hosting for this, the only thing we need is the image link to be able to use it on our WordPress site externally without import.		
			Create a dropbox account -
		
		To begin, first, we will have to make a dropbox account and upload an image in it and get the image link. If you already have a dropbox account then you can skip to the next step “image uploading'' by clicking here.1. First go to https://www.dropbox.com/basic and there click on “Sign Up for Free”.
2. Now here you can sign up using your email or you can just sign up using a Google account. I chose “Sign Up with Google” because it's faster. You can select anything that you feel more comfortable with.3. After selecting the google account you will get a popup that will ask “Dropbox wants access to your Dropbox account” click on allow to continue.		
																														
		4. Now, here add your first name and surname. Click on I agree and then click on “create and continue”.
5. Here select the plan that you need or click on “Continue with 2 GB Dropbox Basic plan” if you don't want to buy any plan.		
																														
		6. Now after selecting your plan or continuing without a plan dropbox.com will ask you to download dropbox on your PC. You can download this software or you can use dropbox from your web browser.Your dropbox account is now ready to host images for your WordPress site.
			Uploading and getting image link -
		
		To upload a new image to your dropbox account first go to https://www.dropbox.com/home and sign in with your account if not signed in already.1. Here click on the “Create” button and then select Folder. Name it anything you want and then click on create.		
																														
		2. Once the folder is created click on the “Upload” button and select files. Upload the image that you want.
																														
		3. Once the image is uploaded, select the image and click on the three dots on the right side. Here click on the “Share” option.		
																														
		4. Now click on “Create Link” and after creating the link click on “Copy link”. The link will look something like this “https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbmigqsmik.png?dl=0”.Change the dropbox url from “www.dropbox.com” to “dl.dropboxusercontent.com” to be able to use it in your website.
Now that we have created the link to our image hosted on an external server, let's see how we can use that external image in our WordPress site without importing it.		
			Adding external image without Import on wordpress-		
		As you know, WordPress doesn't allow you to add external images on your WordPress site without importing them by default.Now to be able to add external images to your WordPress site without import you will have to use a WordPress plugin called “External Media without Import”. 
It's a very helpful plugin made by Zhixiang Zhu which allows you to add external media without import on your WordPress site. Download it from wordpress.org here. Or search for it. It has not been updated in a long time but it still works fine without any problem. Make sure to create a site backup before installing the plugin, just to be on the safe side.1. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard and then go to Plugins&gt;Add New. Search for “External Media without Import”. Install the plugin and then activate it.
																														
		2. To access the plugin. Go to Media&gt; Add External media. 		
																														
		3. Now, here add the URLs of the images that you would like to add to your website. One URL per line. And then click on “Add”		
																														
		4. The image will be now added to your WordPress Media Library. The image won't be imported to your site, it will be served through the external URL and not your site URL.
																														
		 You can now use these external images on anything like featured images, logos, posts, etc.And that's how you can add external images to your WordPress site without import. This will help you a lot in saving the bandwidth and resources of your WordPress site. 		
		Now, one of the cons of using external images on your WordPress site instead of hosting them directly from your server is that the external images won't be indexed on google.
This means that you will lose out on traffic and ranking from google images. To fix that you will have to host the images on your own server. You can still offload the images on your site if you have them hosted on your own server by using an image cdn.Using an image cdn will work the same as using an external image, saving you resources and bandwidth. But the only difference will be that your images will get indexed on google if you use image cdn.Your image will be served from URLs like “cdn.statically.com/img/example.com/cat.png/”
Check out these tutorials on how you can use image cdn on your WordPress site to offload your images -How to use Jetpack Image CDN without Jetpack pluginHow to use Statically CDN on a WordPress blog		
			FAQ -		
			Is it safe to use this WordPress plugin?
		
		Yes, this plugin is safe to use on your WordPress site. It might be a little old but it still works without any problem. I have been using this plugin for more than 6 months on one of my sites and it's still working fine without any problem.		
			Does offloading or using external images on wordpress website helps in making the website faster.		
		Yes, Offloading the images on our wordpress website to a external server helps in making our wordpress website faster. Because it reduces the server load of our own website and also the external image are served through cloud servers that are very fast.",

				"articleBody": "Ever wondered how much traffic your blog can handle without crashing. Well, there is a tool by which you can check how many visitors your blog can handle per minute or second.The tool which we will be using is called loader.io that will help us test our site's performance by sending virtual traffic to our website per second or per minute and giving us back the performance report of our site.
This tool is very easy to set up and use and we can easily set up a load test for our website in minutes.		
			Why you must do a load test of your website before going live -
		
		A website load test is something you must do before launching your website or e-commerce store. Why you might ask? Because by doing a website load test we will be able to see how much traffic our website can handle concurrently without crashing or having a crazy high load time during a traffic surge.
If your website gets crashed during a traffic surge then you can lose a lot of money because your site won't load or will have a very high loading time which will send customers away from your site. That's why it's best to load test your website using this online tool before launching it. So, that you can prepare for a traffic surge in your website to avoid it getting crashed.		
			Website load test online using Loader.io -
		
		To do a website load test online we will use this online Application load testing Tool called Loader.io. 
1. First go to the site and here you will need to make a new account. Click on “Sign Up Now” and then select the Plan you need. Click on Sign Up Now again below the plan you want to use.2. Now here you will need to give your company name or any name you want and after that add your email and a secure password. And after that click on “Sign Up”.		
																														
		3. After that you will need to verify your email. Go to your email app and there you will receive an email from Loader.io. Click on the “Verify me” link to verify your email.
																														
		4. Your account will be verified after going to the link. After that, you can log in to your Loader.io account using the email and the password that you provided.5. After logging in to your Loader.io account you will get an option to add a “New Host”. You can add your website by clicking on the “New Host” button.		
																														
		6. Now here you will need to add your domain name. Add your domain name and then click on the “Verify” button to continue.
																														
		7. To verify that you own that website you will have to copy the verification token that they give you and then add it to your website.		
																														
		8. Copy the verification code and open a new notepad file. Paste the verification code in the txt file and then save the file with the name as the verification code. Like “loaderio-753f78a8b2f4d1051db444f419f24e29.txt”.		
																														
		9. Now using FTP or File Manager in WordPress upload the txt file to your website’s root directory.
																														
		10. After uploading the verification code to your website go back to Loader.io and click on the “Verify” button. If you uploaded your verification code correctly then it will show “Congrats, target verification passed!” after clicking the verify button.Click on “New Test” to create a new test.		
																														
		11. Here in the “Test Name” give it anything you want. And in “Test type” you can select 3 methods - Clients per test, Clients per second, Maintain client load. Select the one you want.
																														
		In clients, select the number of clients you want to visit your website during the given time. In Duration select the time you want for this test to run.12. After setting these up, scroll down to the bottom and then click on “Run Test”.13. After you click on “run test” the test will start and loader.io will send the number of visitors you added in settings to your website over the period of time you gave. 
Now here you will be able to see all the things you need to see how well your site is performing. Most important is the “Response time” because a high response time means your site is not able to handle that load properly. 		
																														
		If you see a spike in the response time in the graph below. Then it means that your server is having a hard time processing the requests. Also in Response Counts, if you see any timeout then it means that the server failed to process a request.You can test out different settings in Loader.io to see how your website performs during a traffic surge which will help you prepare for a traffic surge in the future.
And that is how you can do a website load test online using Loader.io in a few easy steps.		
			Frequently asked questions -
		
			Does doing a website load test can break my site?		
		No, doing a website load test won't break your website. But what it can do is crash your website's server for a few minutes meaning that you won't be able to access your website for a few minutes.This will get fixed automatically after you stop the load testing. And after that, you will be able to access your website without any problem.
			Does my web hosting provider allow load testing?
		
		Now load testing a website is something that not all hosting providers allow you to do. Because if you are using any shared hosting then you can cause problems for other users on the same server as you will use up all the resources of that server.That's why it's important to contact your hosting provider before doing a website load test otherwise your web hosting account might get banned for abuse.One more thing you should know is that doing a website load test uses a lot of resources from a server which means that if you are hosting your website on a limited resources hosting plan then you might have to pay some extra money to keep your site running. 
Because otherwise, they will just lower the resources provided to your website and make it go down.This is not a problem in VPS hosting as you get a server with dedicated resources and not shared resources.

			How to make my website handle more load without crashing?
		
		If you want your website to be able to handle more load then what you can do is enable caching. You will have to enable caching on your website and serve your content through a cdn.
You will also have to offload your images and website files to external cdn providers to make your website fast and make it handle more users without any problem.You can check out this full tutorial on how we can handle million of visitors on shared hosting easily- Handle million visitors on shared hosting.If you liked this post then do make sure to share it with your friends and also to comment down in the comments.

				"articleBody": "Is it even possible to host a blog that can handle millions of visitors on shared hosting? The answer is YES, it is possible to make a blog handle millions of visitors on shared hosting.So, you might be thinking how is it even possible to do something like that. Like how can a shared hosting handle that much traffic? Well, the answer is easy. 
We use a proper WordPress setup with all the things we need like caching and cdn to make a simple blog that can handle that much amount of traffic.Note: You can only make a blog handle that much traffic if it has less dynamic content. For example, our site netmiko.com has very little dynamic content.		
			Why shared hosting is enough for a Blog -
		
		Shared hosting is something that many people think is trash and very slow and unreliable. But with proper caching and cdn you can make a shared hosting work like a VPS.
With the usage of proper caching and cdn, I was able to make my blog that is hosted on HostGator shared hosting handle 5000 users per second. Yes, that's right “per second”.Now, If you compare it to a blog that is hosted on shared hosting without cache and cdn then that blog will barely be able to handle 5 users per second.Now again I want to tell you that these methods will only work if your blog is not very dynamic. Like the only thing that is dynamic on our blog is the search bar. And everything else is static and remains the same until I publish a new blog post.
Now let’s see how we can make a simple WordPress blog handle millions of visitors on shared hosting.		
			Choose web hosting and Install WordPress -		
		The first thing we will need is reliable shared web hosting. There are lots of shared hosting companies out there but I recommend you to use HostGator which is reliable and fast. 		
			
						Get best shared hosting 
					
		One web host that I don't recommend is hostinger. I had one hell of a horrible experience with their shared hosting. So whatever you do, don't fall for their marketing tricks.
You can use either HostGator or Bluehost shared hosting for your blog. We need shared hosting that can handle the sudden traffic surge.Now, after you have bought the web hosting you will need to install WordPress in it. During WordPress installation make sure to unselect any bloat plugins that are installed during a WordPress installation by default.
Because we want a bloat-free WordPress installation, which is faster.		
			Setup a Cloudflare account -
		
		Now, we will need to create a Cloudflare account and add our site to Cloudflare. Cloudflare will help in handling all the traffic instead of our web hosting. If you don't know what Cloudflare is and how it works then here is a simple explanation.
So, basically, Cloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN) that stores and distributes the content of your website around the world.Meaning that all the contents of your website will be stored in different Cloudflare edge servers around the world and whenever a user visits your website then instead of fetching the contents of your site from your origin server the contents will be fetched from Cloudflare servers.This means that your web hosting won't need to handle that traffic because it will be handled by Cloudflare.
1. To set up a Cloudflare account first go to cloudflare.com. Now, click on Sign UP.2. Enter your email and enter any password and click on create an account. After that, you will need to select Cloudflare for infrastructure.		
																														
		3. Here you will need to enter your domain name. After that, you need to scroll down and select the free plan. 
																														
		4. In Review DNS records scroll down and click continue. Now in Change your Nameservers you will need to copy the Cloudflare nameservers.		
																														
		5. Now go to your domain name provider from where you bought the domain name. Then go to Nameservers. Here remove the default nameservers and add the Cloudflare nameservers and save it. Changing Nameservers can be different for different companies so make sure to google it.6. Wait a few minutes for DNS to propagate.
7. After adding the nameservers in your domain Registrar go back to Cloudflare and then click on “Done, check nameservers”.8. Now in the QuickStart guide click on “get started”. After that Turn on all the options and click save. Then click on Finish.		
																														
		It might take a few minutes to a few hours for DNS to propagate so check your Cloudflare dashboard after a few minutes. Here you will see a notice if Cloudflare is connected successfully.
																														
		Your Cloudflare account is created so now let's continue to the next step.		
			Install and Setup WP Cloudflare Super Page Cache -
		
		Now to control the caching of Cloudflare we will use a lightweight plugin called “WP Cloudflare Super Page Cache”. You can search for it or download it from here.After downloading the plugin install it and then activate it. 
You can access the WP Cloudflare plugin from settings&gt;WP Cloudflare Super Page Cache.1. Once you are in the setting of the plugin. Scroll down a little bit and then here you will need to add your Cloudflare email and Cloudflare API key.2. To get the API key go to cloudflare.com and then Log In using your email. After that select your site. 
3. Now after selecting your site you will be in the overview so scroll down a little and on the Right side, you will see an option that says “Get your API token” click it.		
																														
		4. Here scroll down a little and there you will see “Global API Key”. On the right side of it, you will get the View option. Once you click the View option Cloudflare will ask you for your password.After entering the password you will get the API key which you will need to copy. Note: Don't share this API key with anyone.
5. After copying the API key go back to WP Cloudflare Super Page Cache settings and then paste the API key and enter your email id of Cloudflare, then click Update settings.		
																														
		6. Now here you will need to scroll down and click on “select a domain name” and then select your domain. Then click on Update settings.7. After that here Click on “ENABLE PAGE CACHING NOW”. The plugin setup is now complete. To test that click on “TEST CACHE”.
If it says that page caching is working correctly then it means that Cloudflare cdn is now enabled on your site.You can change some settings you don't want from WP Cloudflare Super Page Cache settings. But I would recommend keeping the default settings as they work on all kinds of blogs.Your site can now handle millions of visitors per month on shared web hosting.See the Website Load Test here. But there is still one more thing that needs to be set up to avoid crashing your site. And that thing is images.
			Setup CDN for Images -
		
		Now, the problem with Cloudflare is that whenever you clear the cache of your website then all the cached images, HTML, js, CSS of your site will be cleared meaning that Cloudflare will request all the resources of your website from your webserver until its cached in Cloudflare again.This means that there will be a surge in resource usage which can crash your website. This is not a problem with sites that don't contain images in them, but if your site contains lots of images then you will need to use an external cdn for images.So, if you use an external image cdn then even if you clear the cache for your website Cloudflare will only be able to clear the cache of the Html, CSS, and js and not the images because the images will be served from an external cdn that Cloudflare has no control on.
This means that all the Html, CSS, js will be served through Cloudflare and the images will be served through an external cdn which means that the load on our web hosting will be very low.Now, let's see how we can add an external image cdn. We will be using statically image cdn in our blog. You can see the full tutorial of how we can use statically cdn on our WordPress blog.1. To set up statically cdn for our blog we will first install the statically plugin. You can search for it and download it from here. Install and then activate the plugin.
2. To start the setup click on the statically plugin icon in the admin menu. Now here you will need to generate a Statically API key. That you can get by going to this link here.3. Once you are on the statically website, scroll down a little and enter your email and domain. Agree to the privacy policy and then click on the Generate API key button.4. After that copy the API key shown there and then go back to statically plugin settings and paste the API key. After that click on save changes.
And that's it, your images will now be served through statically image cdn instead of your origin server, and clearing the Cloudflare cache will not affect it.By default, the Image files will be cached on the CDN for 1 year.Now let's take a load test of our website to see how much load it can handle.		
			Load test the blog -		
		For load testing our website, we used Loader.io. Which is a free load testing application that tests our website using thousands of concurrent connections.
To begin, I created an account in Loader.io and selected their free plan. After that in Target Host, I added my domain name and verified it using a txt file.Then I created a new test where in Test Type I selected “ Clients per second “ and the number of clients per second was 500. It's like 500 users visiting your site at one time per second.
The test ran for 1min with 500+ users per second doing HTTPS get requests. The average response time was below 600ms and there were 0 Timeouts. This means that this setup can easily handle millions of visitors per month without any problem.		
																														
		You might see a high response time in the beginning but after that, the response time gets stable and goes lower once the page is cached properly.And that's how you can make a Blog handle millions of visitors on shared hosting.If you liked this post then do make sure to share it with your friends and also make sure to comment down below.

				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can use Jetpack Image CDN without installing the Jetpack plugin. Jetpack image cdn helps in increasing the image load speed and making a site faster.We will use a Custom PHP code with the CDN enabler plugin to use Jetpack CDN without Jetpack plugin.
Talking about a faster site, everybody wants a faster site. And when people talk about making a site’s loading speed faster, The first thing that comes to everyone's mind is a powerful web hosting like a VPS or Cloud.But what if I told you that you can get those god-like speeds using a shared hosting like HostGator shared hosting. To achieve a very fast website the first thing you must do is to use CDN for your site’s images. Because images are bulky, it takes a lot of space and bandwidth which can lower the performance of your website.
If you look at our previous post that was “how to use statically cdn on a WordPress blog” then in that post I talked about how Image CDN has helped our site in reducing its bandwidth usage by almost 70%. This means that if you use Jetpack Image CDN ( Formerly Photon ) and Regular CDN for static resources along with a cache plugin in your WordPress site then your site can easily handle thousands of visitors daily even on a shared web hosting. So, what exactly is Jetpack Image CDN?
			What is Jetpack Image CDN or Photon CDN?		
		Jetpack Image CDN or Photon CDN is a Content Delivery Network. This means that the images on your website will be stored in edge servers around the world and whenever a user requests for the image then the image will be served to the user from the edge server instead of your origin server.The user will get the image from the closest edge server meaning that the user will be able to receive the image faster. Jetpack Image CDN will help you a lot in lowering the resource usage of your website. Because the images will be stored in edge servers and also served from there.
And the best thing about Jetpack Image CDN is that it is free. and you can use it on your website without paying anything.Now, let us see how we can use Jetpack Image CDN without using the Jetpack plugin.		
			Add Jetpack Image CDN without Jetpack plugin -		
		To start using Jetpack Image CDN on your site without the use of the jetpack plugin you will have to first download the CDN enabler plugin. This is a very lightweight plugin that will allow us to use jetpack cdn.
Note: Before you proceed further make sure you have the latest backup of your site. In case something goes wrong. 1. Now to start, first you will need to Log In to your admin dashboard. After logging into your admin dashboard you will need to go to plugins and then click on add new.		
																														
		2. Here you will need to search for CDN Enabler in the search bar. Now click on install and after the installation finishes, you will need to click on activate which will activate the plugin.
																														
		3. The CDN Enabler settings can be found in settings&gt;cdn enabler. Go to settings and then go to CDN Enabler.		
																														
		4. Now here you will need to add the CDN hostname which is - i0.wp.com, i1.wp.com, i2.wp.com, i3.wp.com. You can use any one of them.After that in CDN Inclusions you will need to add these - avif, gif, jpeg, jpg, mp3, png, svg, webpAnd in CDN Exclusions you will need to add these - js, json, mp4, pdf, apk, css		
																														
		After that scroll down and click on Save Changes. Don't click on Save Changes and Validate Configuration.
5. Now after clicking on Save Changes. Go to Appearance&gt;Theme Editor.If you don't see any theme editor option then you will need to download a file manager plugin which you can deactivate after finishing up Jetpack Image CDN setup. 		
																														
		6. Here, click on the functions.php file. Where we will need to add a piece of code to make the cdn work.		
																														
		7. After clicking on the functions.php file you will need to scroll down to the bottom of the file and after you reach the bottom, here you will need to copy-paste and add the code given below.
			// Jetpack image CDN START
add_filter( 'cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite', 'filter_cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite' );
function filter_cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite( $rewritten_contents ) {
    $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'i0.wp.com/', 'i0.wp.com/example.com/', $rewritten_contents );
    $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'i0.wp.com/', 'i0.wp.com/example.com/', $rewritten_contents );
    return $rewritten_contents;
}
// Jetpack image CDN END
		
																														
		Here instead of “i0.wp.com”, you will need to add the CDN hostname that you gave in the CDN Enabler settings. And in the place of example.com, you will need to add your domain name.After adding these things you will need to click on the update file. This will save the file and which means that your site will now deliver the images through Jetpack Image CDN.8. To check whether it is working properly or not you will have to go to your site and then right-click on any image and then click on “Open image in new Tab”.
																														
		9. Here if the image URL is i0.wp.com or any hostname that you added then it means that Jetpack Image CDN is working properly.		
																														
		If you see a broken image then recheck all the settings. Because you might have missed a step or typed something wrong.Now if you face any problem while adding Jetpack Image CDN to your WordPress site then you can always use the Jetpack plugin. Which I don't recommend because it's a very bulky plugin. But if nothing works then you will have to use the Jetpack plugin eventually. 
			Add Jetpack Image CDN using Jetpack plugin - 		
		To add Jetpack Image CDN using the Jetpack plugin you will need to first go to plugins&gt;Add new and after that search for Jetpack here. Then click on install and after that click on Activate.Now after activating the plugin the plugin will redirect you to its setup page where you will need to complete the steps to enable jetpack cdn.Now here you need to click on “Setup Jetpack”. It will take some time and then display “Jetpack is activated!”. After that, on the top right corner, you will get an “x”. Click it.

				"articleBody": "Do you own a WordPress blog that uses a lot of images? Well then, statically cdn is something that you must use on your blog. Because if you are hosting your blog on shared hosting then chances are that you will soon run out of server resources. 
This means that you will need to upgrade your hosting plan which will cost you extra money.So, you might ask what is statically cdn and how it can help my WordPress blog.		
			What is Statically CDN?		
		According to the developer of statically.io Frans Allen, statically is a free CDN for developers that helps web developers in serving their files through a cdn ( content delivery network ) throughout the world.
It has lots of features like resizing images just by changing the URL, taking a screenshot of a site, serving the images of your website through cdn. You can also use it to deliver CSS, JS, SVG, HTML, and XML files through a cdn.You can follow Frans Allen on Twitter at @fransallen.		
			How can statically cdn help my WordPress blog?
		
		Statically cdn can help you a lot in increasing your site’s speed by serving the images of your site from powerful and fast edge servers. 
This means that when a visitor’s browser requests for an image on your blog then instead of fetching the image from your origin server the image will be fetched from these edge servers that have your image cached with them.Statically cdn also helps in reducing your site’s bandwidth usage. Because on a WordPress blog like mine almost 90% of the bandwidth is used by images. So, that's why you must use statically cdn for your blog.After I started using statically on this site the bandwidth usage almost dropped by 70%. Which is a lot. 
So, now let’s see how we can add statically cdn to our WordPress blog. I will be showing you two ways to do this. The first method is recommended for beginners.		
			Add statically using a plugin - 		
		NOTE: Statically CDN plugin is no longer available in the wordpress repository, to use statically cdn on your wordpress blog, you will need to follow the other method given below which uses cdn enabler plugin.		
		The easiest way to add statically cdn to your WordPress blog is to use the statically plugin. This is the recommended method as it is very easy to set it up and it also provides you some extra features like converting your images to webp version and clearing the cache.Now let's see how we can install and set up statically plugin on our WordPress blog.
1. First go to your WordPress admin dashboard and then on the left sidebar go to plugins and click “add new”.		
																														
		2. Now in the search bar you will need to search for “Statically”. Click install and after that click on the activate button.		
																														
		3. You can access the statically plugin settings by clicking on the icon in the sidebar of the admin dashboard.
																														
		4. Now for statically plugin to work you will need an API key which you can make by going to the link shown here.		
																														
		5. Once you are in the statically.io website scroll a little bit down and here you can now get an API key by filling up the information required. Add your email, domain name without www and then accept the privacy policy and click “Generate API key”.		
																														
		6. Now after clicking the Generate API Key button you will get an API Key that you will need to copy. Make sure you keep this API key somewhere safe.
																														
		7. Now go to your statically settings again and paste the API key that you copied. And click on Save changes.		
																														
		8. By default Statically will serve your blog visitors the webp version of images which if you want to keep then you can keep it but if you don't want statically to change your image type then you will need to go to “Speed” to fix this.		
																														
		9. Here you will need to untick the “Automatically generate webp versions” and then click on the save changes button.
																														
		10. Now to check if statically cdn is working on your WordPress blog or not and serving images through cdn. You will need to open an incognito tab in your browser and type your blog URL. Here you will need to select any image and right-click on it and then click on the “open image in new tab”.		
																														
		11. Here you can see whether the image is being served through Statically cdn or not. You will see cdn.statically.io at the beginning of the URL which means it's working fine.
																														
		After the setup finishes make sure you check all the features of your blog whether they are working properly or not.Now let us see the second method which is more flexible meaning that you could add other cdn providers also using this method.		
			Add statically using CDN Enabler -		
		This method requires you to add some code in your WordPress functions.php so make sure you have a backup before proceeding any further. This method is only recommended for advanced users.
1. First, go to plugins&gt;Add new. Now here you will need to search for “CDN enabler”. Click install and then click on activate.		
																														
		2. To access cdn enabler settings, you will need to go to settings, and there you will get the cdn enabler option. Click on it.		
																														
		3. Now here in the CDN hostname you will need to type “cdn.statically.io”. And after that in CDN Exclusions, you need to add some strings that will not be cached. Here are the strings that you need to exclude - .php, .js, .json, .mp4, .pdf, .apk, .css
																														
		4. After that go down a little and remove the default API key and Zone ID and then click on Save.		
																														
		5. Now you will need to go to Appearance&gt;theme editor and select the functions.php file. If there is no theme editor option then you will need to download a file manager plugin.		
																														
		6. Scroll down to the bottom of the functions.php file and then add this code to it.
			add_filter( 'cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite', 'filter_cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite' );
function filter_cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite( $rewritten_contents ) {
    $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'cdn.statically.io/', 'cdn.statically.io/img/mydomain/', $rewritten_contents );
    $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'cdn.statically.io/', 'cdn.statically.io/img/mydomain/', $rewritten_contents );
    return $rewritten_contents;
}		
																														
		In the place of mydomain you will need to add your domain name. And then click on the Update file button.Go to your site in incognito tab to check if it's working properly. You can always contact me on twitter or comment below if something is not working.		
			Does using statically cdn increase image loading speed?		
		Yes, it does, using statically cdn has helped me a lot in increasing my site’s load speed because my origin servers don't need to provide the users with the same image again and again. 
Instead, the images are fetched from fast edge servers that have that image cached with them. Statically cdn has helped me in reducing the image load speed from 0.4 seconds to 0.2 seconds. Which doesn't sound like a lot but is a very big difference when it comes to user experience.		
																														
			Is statically cdn free?		
		Yes, statically cdn is currently free and has no limit on any bandwidth. You can use it on an unlimited amount of websites with unlimited bandwidth. You can also donate to statically.io on its official website to keep it running. And follow its founder Frans Allen on Twitter here for updates regarding statically.
			Is it safe to use statically?
		
		It is completely safe to use statically cdn. If you face any problem like broken images or weird redirects then you can just disable the plugin and the problem will be fixed. If you are unable to access the admin dashboard then you could just go to your web hosting file manager and go to wp-content&gt;plugins and then rename the statically plugin folder which will disable it.You can also try and use the second method if the first method creates any problem in your WordPress blog.
			Is there any alternative to statically cdn?		
		Yes, there is a very good alternative to statically cdn, which is jetpack cdn ( photon ).But the problem is that the jetpack plugin is very bulky meaning that the plugin will slow down your WordPress blog which is the thing that we are trying to prevent.So, I would recommend you to use statically cdn in your blog. 
I will soon make a post on how you can use jetpack cdn on your WordPress blog without the jetpack plugin. Until then you can use statically. I will link to the blog post here as soon as I post it.Use Jetpack Image CDN with using Jetpack plugin.If you liked this post and it helped you in making your WordPress blog faster then make sure to share it with your friends and family and also recommend it to someone who needs it. If you face any problem while setting up statically cdn then do comment below and I will fix the problem for you. Thank you.",
