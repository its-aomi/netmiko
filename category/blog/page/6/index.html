				"articleBody": "Today we’ll see how we can install AutoDock vina on our ubuntu system easily. You can easily install AutoDock vina on your ubuntu if you follow the steps given below. Before starting the installation process, first, we’ll have to update and upgrade our ubuntu apt packages and system. You can do that by typing the following commands in the terminal -
			sudo apt-get update		
			sudo apt-get upgrade		
		It will take a little bit of time for it to finish depending upon your internet speed. After the update and upgrade finishes, you can now start the installation process of AutoDock Vina.		
			Download MGLTools and AutoDock -
		
		The first step will be to download MGLTools and AutoDock in our ubuntu. To download these packages you can either download them directly from their websites or you can use the terminal to download the packages. First lets see how we can download MGLTools and AutoDock Vina using the terminal. Before typing the download command make sure you have wget installed on your ubuntu. If wget is not installed on your system then you can install it by using this command -
			Download using Terminal -		
			sudo apt-get install wget
		
		After installing wget,  download MGLTools. First, create a new directory on your desktop with the name \"newdirectory\" by using this command -		
			mkdir -p newdirectory
		
		We’ll download the packages in this new directory. After creating the new directory we’ll change our working directory from the current one to the new one that we created 		
			cd newdirectory
		
		After that, by using the wget command we’ll download the latest version of MGLTools.
			wget http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads/tars/releases/REL1.5.6/mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6.tar.gz
		
		Alternative download link for MGLTools - https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/downloads/		
		(OPTIONAL) If your system is not 64bit and is 32bit then use this command instead of the above one - 		
			wget http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads/downloads/tars/releases/REL1.5.6/mgltools_i86Linux2_1.5.6.tar.gz		
		After downloading MGLTools, download AutoDock Vina using the command		
			wget http://vina.scripps.edu/download/autodock_vina_1_1_2_linux_x86.tgz
		
		After this, we’ll need to download the AutoDocksuite so that we can run AutoDock4 analysis.Here’s the command to download AutoDocksuite.
			sudo wget http://autodock.scripps.edu/downloads/autodock-registration/tars/dist426/autodocksuite-4.2.6-x86_64Linux2.tar		
		Okay, so all the required packages are now downloaded to our directory. Now before we start the installation we’ll need to download a library.Sometimes you might get an imaging C module error which you can fix by downloading and installing a library.		
			sudo apt-get install libjpeg62:i386		
			Download using Web Browser -		
		To download MGLTools using Web Browser first go to this link here - http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads NOTE: This website can sometimes be down so, try this alternative link.
Here select the version you want, 64-bit version or the 32-bit version. The 64-bit version name will be \"mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6.tar.gz\".Now to download AutoDock Vina and AutoDock suite using Web Browser we will go to these links here -AutoDock Vina - http://vina.scripps.edu/download/autodock_vina_1_1_2_linux_x86.tgzAutoDock suite - http://autodock.scripps.edu/downloads/autodock-registration/tars/dist426/autodocksuite-4.2.6-x86_64Linux2.tarAfter downloading these file, create a new directory called \"newdirectory\" and move these files inside that directory. After that follow the steps below to complete the installation.
			Install MGLTools and AutoDock Vina -
		
		Okay, so now that we have downloaded all the files required for the installation let's continue to the next step. First, we’ll install MGLTools. To install MGLTools first we’ll unzip the tar file. Use this command to do that - 		
			tar xvzf mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6.tar.gz		
		After the tar file unzips, there will be a new folder named “mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6 '' inside the “newdirectory” folder.Now change your working directory from “newdirectory” to “mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6” using this command - 
			cd mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6
		
		Once you are inside this directory run the install.sh file to install MGLTools.		
			./install.sh
		
		After typing this command the installation of MGLTools will start. If there’s a “Commercial Usage” popup appearing on your screen then click on the OK button.		
																														
		Once the installation has finished we can continue to the next step which is to install AutoDock Vina.
Change your working directory back to \"newdirectory\" using the command -		
			cd ..		
		Now you'll need to unzip the AutoDock tar file. Use this command to unzip the tar file -		
			tar xvzf autodock_vina_1_1_2_linux_x86.tgz
		
		That's it, the Installation of MGLTools and AutoDock Vina has been completed. Now we’ll need to create an alias in our bash file.
			Edit the Bashrc File -
		
		We’ll have to create an alias now for AutoDock vina and pymol viewer. To do that we'll have to edit the Bashrc file.First, you will have to change your working directory from newdirectory to the root directory.		
			cd ..
		
		After that, type the command given below in the terminal. This will open the Bashrc file in the default text editor of ubuntu.		
			sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
		
		Here, inside the Bashrc file go to the bottom of the file. Now below the last line enter these lines.
			alias adt='sudo /home/username/newdirectory/mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6/bin/adt'
alias pmv='sudo /home/username/newdirectory/mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.6/bin/pmv'
		
		Now the file path here after sudo will be different for everyone. It depends upon where you installed MGLTools.In place of username type your own username. Other things will be same if you followed my steps.After that, on the top left, click on the Save button and then click on the red x button to close the editor.
Now we’ll type the final command that will finish the installation process of AutoDock Vina.		
			source ~/.bashrc
		
		And, that's it, AutoDock Vina is now installed successfully on your ubuntu system. You can open AutoDock Vina by typing “adt” in the terminal. And to open the pymol viewer we’ll type pmv in the terminal.		
																														
		If you are facing any problem while installing AutoDock Vina, then you can contact me on Instagram or you can comment below. Thank you. How to Install AutoDock Vina on Ubuntu 20.04 - Step by StepWatch this video on YouTube

			Frequently Asked Questions -		
			Can I install AutoDock Vina without Root permissions?		
		Yes, you can install AutoDock vina without having root permissions. Download the packages using your web browser and then install it.Update: To edit the bashrc file, you can do that without using sudo at the back like \"gedit ~/.bashrc\".",

				"articleBody": "When we host our images on dropbox and then use those external images on our WordPress site then the loading time of those images is generally very high. It takes around 1 - 2 seconds for those images to load.
NOTE: You can use this method with any other image hosting service. Like for example- Google Photos.


Now having that high loading times for images in a blog is a very bad thing. Sometimes the user will just scroll past the image without even seeing it as it takes a long time to load. Also, it looks very bad when your image loading takes a long time.

On average the image loading time in a blog should be between 0.1ms to 0.4ms. If it's more than that, then it's considered a very poor performance which can also hamper the image of your blog.&nbsp;

To fix that, what we can do is use an image CDN. An image CDN will cache our images on lightning-fast edge servers that will then be served to users at a very high speed.&nbsp;



Although there are lots of Image CDN services out there, I will recommend you to use Statically Image CDN or Jetpack Image CDN as both of these are free to use and have no bandwidth limit. Meaning you can use these on high-traffic sites also.

Now, let's see how we can Serve Dropbox Images through a CDN.

Here are the steps -&nbsp;

 	Install and Activate CDN Enabler
 	Configure CDN Enabler settings
 	Add custom PHP code&nbsp;
 	Get dropbox image link
 	Add dropbox image without import


Install and Activate CDN Enabler Plugin -
You can easily serve images through a cdn in WordPress by using a Plugin called CDN Enabler.
To begin, first, Log In to the admin dashboard of your WordPress site. Now, we will need to install and activate the “CDN Enabler” plugin.

1. On the left menu of your admin dashboard, go to Plugins&gt;Add New. Here in the search bar, search for “CDN Enabler”. Install and activate the plugin.




2. You can now Access the plugin settings by going to Settings&gt;CDN Enabler.

Once the plugin is installed and activated we will have to configure some settings in the CDN Enabler plugin.
Configure CDN Enabler Settings -
Go to CDN Enabler settings from “Settings&gt;CDN Enabler” in the Admin menu. After that follow the steps below.



Once you are in the CDN Enabler settings, you will need to add a hostname. The hostname is the domain name of the CDN service you are using. I'll show you how you can do this using statically image CDN, which is a free service.&nbsp;

You can see this post if you want to use jetpack image cdn instead - How to use Jetpack Image CDN without Jetpack plugin.

1. In the Hostname type ”cdn.statically.io”. Here cdn.statically.io is our hostname from where our dropbox images will be served through a cdn.



2. After that in the CDN inclusions remove the default file extensions add these file extensions - “.avif .gif .jpeg .jpg .mp3 .png .svg .webp”. Add these one by one per line.



3. Now in CDN Exclusions we’ll add these file extensions - “.js .json .mp4 .pdf .apk .css”. After adding both inclusion and exclusion scroll down a little and click on Save Changes.



Okay, so the configuration of the plugin is done, now let's add the custom PHP code in our WordPress theme to serve the dropbox images through cdn.


Add custom PHP code -
Now, for the plugin to serve the external images like dropbox images through the cdn we will have to add two pieces of code to our WordPress functions.php file.

The first piece of code will help in serving all the internal images which you uploaded to your WordPress site through cdn and the second code will help in serving all the images with the domain name “dl.dropboxusercontent.com” from cdn.

As you know that dropbox images are served through the domain name “dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k2ka1k3ahljs8re/cat1.jpg”

which we will rewrite to its cdn version like “cdn.statically.io/img/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k2ka1k3ahljs8re/cat1.jpg”


If you want to know how you can host images on dropbox and use them on your WordPress site without import then check this post out - External images without import on WordPress.
1. Now, let's add the custom PHP code to our WordPress site. First, go to “Appearance&gt;Theme Editor” from your WordPress admin dashboard.

2. Here, click on the Functions.php file. After that scroll down to the bottom of the functions.php file.



3. After that copy the first piece of PHP code from below and paste it at the bottom of the functions.php file.
/* START IMAGE CDN */
add_filter( 'cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite', 'filter_cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite' );
function filter_cdn_enabler_contents_after_rewrite( $rewritten_contents ) {
    $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'example.com/', 'example.com/img/mydomain.com/', $rewritten_contents );
    $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'example.com/', 'example.com/img/mydomain.com/', $rewritten_contents );

Here, in place of example.com add the CDN hostname which is “cdn.statically.io”. And after that in place of mydomain.com add your domain name.

4. Now, after that, add this second piece of PHP code below the first one. In this code, you can change the dropbox URL to any other image host that you are using. Like if you are using imgur.com then change “dl.dropboxusercontent.com” to “imgur.com”.


/* SERVE EXTERNAL IMAGES */
    if ( class_exists( 'CDN_Enabler_Engine' ) ) {
        $cdn_hostname = CDN_Enabler_Engine::$settings['cdn_hostname'];
        $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'dl.dropboxusercontent.com/', $cdn_hostname . '/img/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/', $rewritten_contents );
        $rewritten_contents = str_replace( 'dl.dropboxusercontent.com/', $cdn_hostname . '/img/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/', $rewritten_contents );
    }
    return $rewritten_contents;
}
/* END IMAGE CDN */

Make sure to check everything, if the domain names are correct or not, and then click on “Update Files” at the bottom.

That's it, the external dropbox images on your WordPress site should now load through the image cdn, instead of directly loading from dropbox. Also, the internal images of your site will now load through the image cdn instead of loading directly from your server.

You can also use this method to serve any other external images like google photos, Imgur, imgbb, etc. through a cdn on your WordPress site.


Continue Reading if you want to know how to use dropbox image on your WordPress website without importing it.
Get link of Image Hosted on Dropbox -
You cannot use the regular image link (www.dropbox.com/cat.png) of dropbox to embed an image into your WordPress website or anywhere else. To get the direct image link of the dropbox image follow the steps from below -

 	Log in to your Dropbox account. Select the image that you want to embed to your website.
 	Click on the three dots on the right side. Click on Share.&nbsp;
 	Now click on “Create Link”. After the link has been created, copy the link.



Now change the dropbox image link from “https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2ka1k3ahljs8re/cat1.jpg” to “https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k2ka1k3ahljs8re/cat1.jpg”.
All you need to change here is the domain name. From “www.dropbox.com” to “dl.dropboxusercontent.com”.
You can now embed this image link to your WordPress site using external media without import plugin.


Add the Dropbox image to your WordPress site without Import -
To be able to use external images like dropbox hosted images on your WordPress website you'll need to install a plugin that will allow us to add externally hosted images to our WordPress website without importing it.



Meaning that all you need is the image link and then you can use that image on your website without storing it on your server.

To do that first go to Plugins&gt;Add New. Here search for “External Media without Import”. Install and Activate the plugin.




After activating the plugin you can add images to your media library by going to Media&gt;Add External Media without Import.

Here paste the “dl.dropboxusercontent.com” image link and then click on Add. If you get an error “Failed to get info of the image(s).” Then below in the width make it “1280” and in height make it “720”. Then click on Add again.



Once the image has been added successfully you can now use that image on anything like a logo, blog post, etc. The image will be found in the media library.


Conclusion -
After adding the dropbox hosted image to a post if we left click the image and then click on “Open image in new tab” then you'll see that the image is loading through “cdn.statically.io/img/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cat.png” instead of loading directly through the dropbox server.



You might see the image loading a little slow at first but once it's cached around the world, it will load at lightning-fast speeds.

				"articleBody": "We all love videos on our website and so does google. Now when it comes to adding a video to our WordPress site, most of the users use YouTube to host the video and then embed it on their website.&nbsp;

However, embedding YouTube videos in WordPress does not always work well for some users. Videos can take a long time to load and make the page render slow.



The solution to this problem is that you can embed YouTube videos in WordPress without sacrificing speed by using a WordPress plugin or a piece of code that will only load the YouTube video resources on clicking the video.

Here’s how you can embed YouTube videos to your WordPress site without making your page slow.

 	By using a plugin called “WP YouTube Lyte”. Reduces HTTP requests to YouTube.
 	By using a custom JavaScript code. Adds a static thumbnail and reduces HTTP requests.

I will show you how you can use both of these methods to embed a YouTube video to your WordPress site without compromising the load speed.



First, let's see the easiest method which is by adding a lightweight plugin to our site.
Embed YouTube video using WP YouTube Lyte -
To begin, first, log in to the admin dashboard of your WordPress site. After logging in, go to Plugins&gt;Add New from the admin menu on the left.

Now here in the search bar, search for “WP YouTube Lyte”. Install the plugin and activate it.




The plugin will start working right away after you activate it. But if you want to change some settings like video size and other settings then you can do that by going to Settings&gt;WP YouTube Lyte.



Here you can change settings like Player Size, Player position, etc. You can also choose to add microdata to your Html so that the video shows up in google search.&nbsp;

After changing the settings scroll down and click on “Save Changes”.



Now to add a YouTube video to your website, all you will need to do is \"copy-paste the YouTube video link in the editor\" and the plugin will automatically embed and change it in the frontend of your website.

This plugin helps a lot in reducing the number of HTTP requests your website makes to youtube.com which means that when you use this plugin for embedding a YouTube video to your website then there is little to no effect on the performance of your website.

Now let's see the second method which is the recommended method.


Embed YouTube video with Preview image and load video on click -
Instead of using a plugin, I recommend you to use this method to embed a YouTube video as using a plugin can make your website heavy and also adds extra bloat to it.

So, here's how this method is better than using a plugin. In this method the video is loaded with a static preview image, thus there are no extra HTTP requests to YouTube after the video preview image is loaded.

The video resources will only load when you click on them. If you don't then no extra resources will be loaded.



Now let's see the steps to set this up. To start first we’ll have to go to YouTube Embed Code Generator by Techbrij.

Here on the website, all you need to do is paste the YouTube video link in there and after pasting the link click on the “Preview and Generate Code” button.



NOTE: You can only use “www.youtube.com” links here and not “youtu.be” links.



Once the preview loads, you will need to scroll down a little and Copy the Second piece of code which is a piece of JavaScript code. Copy the JavaScript code from below.
&lt;script&gt; (function() {
    var v = document.getElementsByClassName(\"youtube-player\");
    for (var n = 0; n &lt; v.length; n++) {
        v[n].onclick = function() {
            var iframe = document.createElement(\"iframe\");
            iframe.setAttribute(\"src\", \"//www.youtube.com/embed/\" + this.dataset.id + \"?autoplay=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;border=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;rel=\" + this.dataset.related + \"&amp;controls=\" + this.dataset.control + \"&amp;showinfo=\" + this.dataset.info);
            iframe.setAttribute(\"frameborder\", \"0\");
            iframe.setAttribute(\"id\", \"youtube-iframe\");
            iframe.setAttribute(\"style\", \"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\");
            if (this.dataset.fullscreen == 1) {
                iframe.setAttribute(\"allowfullscreen\", \"\");
            }
            while (this.firstChild) {
                this.removeChild(this.firstChild);
            }
            this.appendChild(iframe);
        };
    }
})(); 
&lt; /script&gt;
Copy this code and after that go back to your WordPress admin dashboard.

Here in the admin dashboard go to Appearance&gt;Theme Editor.



Now here, click on the footer.php file. Scroll down to the bottom of the footer.php file and add the JavaScript code there before the closing body tag.



After adding the JavaScript code click on the Update File button and wait for it to Save. Once saved you will need to go to the post where you want to embed the youtube video.

Select the place where you want to add the YouTube video and add a new HTML block there.




In the HTML block copy-paste the first code that we generated from the techbrij website. After pasting the HTML code in the HTML block you'll need to fix a small problem. You'll need to change the HTTP to HTTPS in the Imgur image link at the bottom of the HTML code.



And that's it, you can now preview the post to see if the YouTube video is loading properly or not. Now the YouTube video resources will only load if you click on the play button and will not hamper the performance of your website.

To embed more videos on your website, all you need to do is go to the Youtube Embed Generator By Techbrij and paste your YouTube video link there and click “Preview and Generate code”.



After that, copy the first HTML code and paste it into your website, change Imgur link from HTTP to HTTPS. And that's it.

You don't need to add the JavaScript code to your website again and again as we already added it to the theme file.

If you are thinking of adding YouTube videos to your WordPress website then make sure to use one of the methods shown above to do that, it is to make sure that embedding a YouTube video to your WordPress site won't make it slow and reduce its performance.

FAQ -
Which method should I use to embed a YouTube video to my WordPress website, Plugin or JavaScript Code?
If you are a beginner to WordPress and don't want to mess with the code of your WordPress files then you can use the plugin. The plugin will allow you to add additional features to your YouTube embed which is good for SEO.



But if you are an advanced user then I will recommend you to use the JavaScript code method because using the plugin adds a lot of extra code to our WordPress website that we don't need. Which can have some amount of impact on our WordPress website performance.

That's why use the JavaScript code method if you want performance and use the plugin if you want both SEO and a little bit of performance.",

Now when you are hosting a WordPress website on GitHub, the dynamic content of your website like the search bar, comment section won't work. As the website will be static and not dynamic.To fix that we will be using google search and Disqus comments on our website that will help us add those functionalities to our WordPress website.Now, the first thing we will do is to install and set up a WordPress site on our local host that we will then connect to our GitHub and publish our website on the internet.		
					
			Install WordPress on Local Host -
		
		So, here’s how it will work. First we will install WordPress on our local host, then we will create static files of our WordPress files using a plugin and then we will push those files to the GitHub repository which will then publish the files to the internet.Now to install WordPress on your local host we will have to first download XAMPP. You can download XAMPP by going to this link here.1. Here click on your operating system. After that XAMPP will be downloaded. After downloading, install XAMPP. 		
																														
		2. Open XAMPP and then start Apache and MySQL. You can now access your local host by typing localhost/ in your web browser.		
																														
		Now to install WordPress in our local host we will first have to download the WordPress zip file from wordpress.org. I am using windows, if you use some other operating system then the steps will be the same. The ways to do them might be a little different.1. Go to https://wordpress.org/download/ . Scroll down a little and there you will get the download button. Click on it to download WordPress. You can also download the old versions of WordPress from https://wordpress.org/download/releases/		
																														
		2. After Downloading the zip file, “right click” on it. Then click on the “Extract To” option. Wait for it to finish extracting.		
																														
		3. Now go inside the extracted folder of WordPress. And copy all the files present there.		
																														
		4. After that go to your “C drive”. And Locate “xampp” folder, go inside xampp folder and locate htdocs, go inside htdocs.5. Here inside the htdocs folder, create a new folder called “localsite”. After that paste all the WordPress files that you copied inside the “localsite” folder.		
																														
		6. Now, go to your web browser and type “localhost/phpmyadmin”. Here click on the “Databases”. 		
																														
		7. In the database name type “localsite” and then click on the create button at the right side. After the database has been created, close the tab and go to “localhost/localsite”.		
																														
		In “localhost/localsite” follow WordPress instructions to complete the installation of WordPress on your local host.In database configuration the database name will be “localsite”, Username will be “root”, remove the password and then click on the submit button. Then click “Run installation”.Make sure to remember the password and username of your WordPress admin during the installation process. Now that our WordPress website has been set up properly on our local host, let's create a GitHub repository to host our website files.		
			Sign up for GitHub and Create a Repository - 		
		All our website files will be hosted on GitHub. And we will be using GitHub pages for setting the site live.To create a GitHub repository first we will have to create a GitHub account. To create a GitHub account go to https://github.com. Here click on the sign-up button on the top right.Enter your email address, a secure password, username and then solve the captcha and create your GitHub account. Verify your email by the code sent to your email address and then follow GitHub's instructions to complete the account setup.		
																														
		Once your account setup is complete, follow the steps below to create a GitHub repository to host your website files.1. Once you are in your GitHub Dashboard Click on the “NEW” button at the top left. You might also see the “Create Repository” option if you have logged in for the first time to your GitHub account.
																														
		2. Now here you'll need to enter your repository name. I recommend you name it the same as your domain name. The repository should be public and not private. Scroll down a little and tick the “add a README file”. After that click on the “Create Repository”.		
																														
		Your repository will be now created. After creating the GitHub repository we will have to now add our GitHub repository to GitHub pages.		
			Add the Repository to GitHub Pages -
		
		To add our repository to GitHub Pages we will have to create a new branch and delete the default main branch.
1. Once you are inside your GitHub Repository click on the “MAIN” button and then in the “Find or create a branch” type gh-pages and then click on the Create branch.		
																														
		2. Now we will need to delete the main branch and make the gh-pages branch the default branch. To do that first go to settings, then to Branches.Here click on the “arrow button” and then click on the “main” button. Select gh-pages and then click on Update. After that click on the “I understand, update the default branch”. 
																														
		Now to delete the “main” branch go back to your repository and click on “Branches”, here in branches click on the delete icon on the main branch, after that go back to &lt;&gt; Code.		
																														
		You can now access your site at \"your-username.github.io/repository-name\"Now to make it look better, easier to read and share let's add a Custom Domain to it.		
			Add Custom Domain to GitHub Pages site -		
		To add a custom domain to your GitHub pages site, first, go to your domain registrar from where you bought the domain name. And then go to the DNS settings.In case you don't have a domain name then you can get a domain name for free using freenom.com, which provides you with free ccTLD domain.I am using Cloudflare so I will use Cloudflare DNS settings. Depending upon what domain name provider you use the DNS settings will be found in different places. Google it.Once you are in the DNS settings, here you will need to add four “A” records pointing to GitHub.1. To do that first select “A” record, in the “name” type your domain name. After that add these IP addresses -  185.199.108.153 -    185.199.109.153 -  185.199.110.153  -  185.199.111.153 		
																														
		2. Add all the four A records and after that wait a few minutes for the DNS to Propagate.		
																														
		If you want the www version of your site to redirect to a non-www version then also add a “CNAME” record. Where in Name it will be “www” and in content it will be your domain name.After 10 mins go back to your GitHub repository and then go to settings. In settings scroll down and look for “Pages”.Click “Pages”. Now here in Pages scroll down and in “Custom Domain” add your domain name and then click on Save.		
																														
		Your Website can now be accessed through the custom domain name.		
			Install GitHub Desktop and Clone Repository -
		
		Now we will install GitHub Desktop and clone our website repository in it. Using GitHub desktop will make it easy to push our website files to our repository.First, go to https://desktop.github.com Download the GitHub exe file to your Desktop and then install it. Make sure to remember the installation path.Once GitHub is installed, Open it. And then sign in to GitHub using your email and password.After signing in to GitHub, go to “File” at the top left corner or Press CTRL+SHIFT+O to clone a repository.		
																														
		Select the repository that we made for our website and then click on “clone”. Remember the Local Folder path displayed at the bottom. We’ll need that.  		
																														
		Wait for the cloning to finish, after the cloning finishes minimize the GitHub Desktop.		
			Create Static WordPress files and push to GitHub Repository - 
		
		As you know that in GitHub we can't host dynamic websites, websites that need a database won't work in GitHub pages. The only important dynamic part of a blog is search and comments which we will add using Disqus and google search.All the other parts of a WordPress site can work easily without a database. To be able to host our WordPress site on GitHub pages we will convert our WordPress files into static files using the “Simply Static” Plugin.First, open XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL. After that log in to your WordPress site hosted on localhost. You can log in to WordPress by going to “localhost/wordpress_folder_name/wp-admin/.Follow these steps here for installing WordPress on localhost.After Logging in to your admin dashboard go to Plugins&gt;Add New. Here search for a plugin called “Simply Static”. Install and activate the plugin.		
																														
		Once the plugin is activated go to Simply Static &gt; Settings from the admin menu on the left.		
																														
		Here, in the Destination URL select “Use absolute URLs, change HTTP to HTTPS and add your domain name. Scroll down a little and in the Delivery Method select “Local directory”.		
																														
		After that, we will have to add the path to our local directory where these static files will be stored. The path will be where our GitHub repository was cloned. Remember the path that was showing below when cloning the repository.		
																														
		Paste that file path in simply static settings and then click on Save Changes.You can easily find the file path by opening GitHub Desktop and clicking “Show in Explorer”. After that copy the file path from the file explorer and paste it into Simply Static settings.STEP 1 - Once settings are saved go to Simply Static&gt; Generate and here click on the generate button. Wait for it to finish.		
																														
		STEP 2 - When it says “Done, Finished” go back to your GitHub Desktop, and here you will see a lot of files automatically appeared here. All you need to do now is give a summary on the bottom left. And then click on “Commit to gh-pages”.		
																														
		STEP 3 - After clicking commit, on the top bar click on the “Push Origin”. Your website files will be now uploaded to your GitHub repository. When \"push origin\" changes to \"Fetch origin\" then it means the files were uploaded to your GitHub repository		
																														
		Your WordPress website is now live and you can access it by typing your domain name. It might take a few minutes for the changes to appear.Note: Every time you change something on your website like adding a post or something else and want to publish it, just follow the three steps shown above.		
			Adding a Custom 404 Page -
		
		Now by default, there is a GitHub 404 page that is not so good. So to fix that we will add a custom 404 page to our site.To do that go inside your repository and here click on “Add File” and then Create a new file.		
																														
		Now in name, you'll have to name it “404.md”, you cannot name it anything else. After naming it, copy the code from below and paste it into the editor. You can also add your code here or make any changes.		
			&lt;html lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
	&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;404.. Page not Found. Return to HOME&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
		
																														
		After adding the code scroll down and click on “Commit new File”. Your website will now have a custom 404 page that you can test by going to any URL that doesn't exist on your website.		
			Adding Disqus Comments to Static WordPress site -
		
		As our WordPress website is a static site, the default comment box won't work as it needs a database to work. So, to be able to add a comment feature to our static site we will use Disqus Comments.Disqus will help us in adding the comments feature to our website.
To start, first, go to https://disqus.com/profile/signup/  and sign up using email or any other ways available. Then select “I want to install Disqus on my site”.Now here in “Create a new site”, Enter your domain name and select the category of your site and then click on Create Site. After that select your Disqus Plan. 		
																														
		Now after selecting the plan close the tab and go to https://disqus.com/admin and click on Settings on the top bar. Click on your domain name. After clicking on your domain name you will be in the admin dashboard of your Disqus site.
Here copy the ShortName. Which you can get in Settings&gt;General.		
																														
		After copying the ShortName Go back to your WordPress Admin. Now go to Plugins&gt;Add New and search for “pipDisqus”. Install the “pipDisqus – Lightweight Disqus Comments” plugin and activate it.After activating the plugin you can access the plugin by going to Settings&gt;pipDisqus.Here in Disqus ShortName add the ShortName that we copied from Disqus Admin and then click on Save Changes.
																														
		That's it, the default WordPress comment box will be replaced with Disqus comments which will work on your static WordPress site.Publish the changes after that.		
			Adding Google Search to Static WordPress site -
		
		Now, this is an optional step, to add a search bar to your static website. You can add one or just live without it. Small sites don't need a search bar anyways.
But if you want to add one then you can follow the steps below. First, go to https://cse.google.com/cse/ and click on Get Started. Sign In with your Google account.After that in “Sites to search” enter your domain name. And in Search Engine enter google. Solve the captcha and click on Create.After that click on “Get Code” and copy the script that is shown on the screen. Paste this script in any place on your site where you want the search bar to show.
You can go to https://cse.google.com/cse/ to change how your search bar looks.		
			Wrapping it Up -
		
		And that's it, that's how you can host a WordPress website on GitHub with a custom domain and with Disqus comments and also a search bar. All the features of a dynamic website in a static website.You can access the site that we used in this tutorial at aomie.tk, do check it out.
Finally, all I want to say is that this post took me three days to finish, so, show some love and comment below. Thank You.		
			FAQ -		
			Q1. What are the Pros of a Static WordPress site hosted on GitHub.
		
		A static WordPress website when hosted on GitHub has lots of pros like it's freaking fast, it's easy to manage, easy to host, easy to make changes and it's very secure. And you won't have to worry about website backup.		
			Q2. What are the bandwidth limit of hosting a wordpress website on github?		
		The bandwidth limit of hosting a wordpress website on GitHub is around 100gb per month / repository. Which is enough bandwidth for a small to medium blog that gets around 30k visitors per month. You can also use Cloudflare on your website to increase its performance, speed and save bandwidth.",

				"name": "How to use External images in WordPress without Import",
				"url": "https://netmiko.com/external-image-without-import-wordpress/",
				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can use external images on your WordPress site without import. NOTE: Skip to \"Adding external image\" if you already have your image link and just want to add it to your WordPress site.Don't skip if you want to know how you can host your website images.
			Why offload images -		
		Images are One of the most important parts of a blog because without images our blog won't look beautiful and won't attract users. Which will lower engagement on our site and also lower our rankings.That's why adding at least three images to a blog post is recommended. Now when it comes to images the problem with images is that images are bulky and take up a lot of bandwidth and storage. Which is something that can cost you a lot of money and also increase the loading time of your website.
That is something that nobody wants. Now to fix that problem what we can do is offload the images, meaning that serving the images from a external server instead of where our website is hosted.Hosting our images in a different place will save us a lot of bandwidth and will also make our website faster and decrease the image loading speed.		
			Where to host website images for offloading -
		
		To offload the images of our site we will have to first choose a reliable place to host our images. There are lots of different image hosting services out there that you can use. 
But those will cost us a lot of money to use. Now If your website is very big then you will have to use paid image hosting.But if it's not and uses less than 20 GB of bandwidth per day then you can use Dropbox for hosting your images. Dropbox gives us 2GB of storage space on a free account which you can increase by buying their paid plan which is very cheap.Now let us see how we can add these images hosted externally to our WordPress site without importing them.
			Hosting image on external server and  getting the link -		
		You can use any image hosting for this, the only thing we need is the image link to be able to use it on our WordPress site externally without import.		
			Create a dropbox account -
		
		To begin, first, we will have to make a dropbox account and upload an image in it and get the image link. If you already have a dropbox account then you can skip to the next step “image uploading'' by clicking here.1. First go to https://www.dropbox.com/basic and there click on “Sign Up for Free”.
2. Now here you can sign up using your email or you can just sign up using a Google account. I chose “Sign Up with Google” because it's faster. You can select anything that you feel more comfortable with.3. After selecting the google account you will get a popup that will ask “Dropbox wants access to your Dropbox account” click on allow to continue.		
																														
		4. Now, here add your first name and surname. Click on I agree and then click on “create and continue”.
5. Here select the plan that you need or click on “Continue with 2 GB Dropbox Basic plan” if you don't want to buy any plan.		
																														
		6. Now after selecting your plan or continuing without a plan dropbox.com will ask you to download dropbox on your PC. You can download this software or you can use dropbox from your web browser.Your dropbox account is now ready to host images for your WordPress site.
			Uploading and getting image link -
		
		To upload a new image to your dropbox account first go to https://www.dropbox.com/home and sign in with your account if not signed in already.1. Here click on the “Create” button and then select Folder. Name it anything you want and then click on create.		
																														
		2. Once the folder is created click on the “Upload” button and select files. Upload the image that you want.
																														
		3. Once the image is uploaded, select the image and click on the three dots on the right side. Here click on the “Share” option.		
																														
		4. Now click on “Create Link” and after creating the link click on “Copy link”. The link will look something like this “https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbmigqsmik.png?dl=0”.Change the dropbox url from “www.dropbox.com” to “dl.dropboxusercontent.com” to be able to use it in your website.
Now that we have created the link to our image hosted on an external server, let's see how we can use that external image in our WordPress site without importing it.		
			Adding external image without Import on wordpress-		
		As you know, WordPress doesn't allow you to add external images on your WordPress site without importing them by default.Now to be able to add external images to your WordPress site without import you will have to use a WordPress plugin called “External Media without Import”. 
It's a very helpful plugin made by Zhixiang Zhu which allows you to add external media without import on your WordPress site. Download it from wordpress.org here. Or search for it. It has not been updated in a long time but it still works fine without any problem. Make sure to create a site backup before installing the plugin, just to be on the safe side.1. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard and then go to Plugins&gt;Add New. Search for “External Media without Import”. Install the plugin and then activate it.
																														
		2. To access the plugin. Go to Media&gt; Add External media. 		
																														
		3. Now, here add the URLs of the images that you would like to add to your website. One URL per line. And then click on “Add”		
																														
		4. The image will be now added to your WordPress Media Library. The image won't be imported to your site, it will be served through the external URL and not your site URL.
																														
		 You can now use these external images on anything like featured images, logos, posts, etc.And that's how you can add external images to your WordPress site without import. This will help you a lot in saving the bandwidth and resources of your WordPress site. 		
		Now, one of the cons of using external images on your WordPress site instead of hosting them directly from your server is that the external images won't be indexed on google.
This means that you will lose out on traffic and ranking from google images. To fix that you will have to host the images on your own server. You can still offload the images on your site if you have them hosted on your own server by using an image cdn.Using an image cdn will work the same as using an external image, saving you resources and bandwidth. But the only difference will be that your images will get indexed on google if you use image cdn.Your image will be served from URLs like “cdn.statically.com/img/example.com/cat.png/”
Check out these tutorials on how you can use image cdn on your WordPress site to offload your images -How to use Jetpack Image CDN without Jetpack pluginHow to use Statically CDN on a WordPress blog		
			FAQ -		
			Is it safe to use this WordPress plugin?
		
		Yes, this plugin is safe to use on your WordPress site. It might be a little old but it still works without any problem. I have been using this plugin for more than 6 months on one of my sites and it's still working fine without any problem.		
			Does offloading or using external images on wordpress website helps in making the website faster.		
		Yes, Offloading the images on our wordpress website to a external server helps in making our wordpress website faster. Because it reduces the server load of our own website and also the external image are served through cloud servers that are very fast.",

				"articleBody": "Ever wondered how much traffic your blog can handle without crashing. Well, there is a tool by which you can check how many visitors your blog can handle per minute or second.The tool which we will be using is called loader.io that will help us test our site's performance by sending virtual traffic to our website per second or per minute and giving us back the performance report of our site.
This tool is very easy to set up and use and we can easily set up a load test for our website in minutes.		
			Why you must do a load test of your website before going live -
		
		A website load test is something you must do before launching your website or e-commerce store. Why you might ask? Because by doing a website load test we will be able to see how much traffic our website can handle concurrently without crashing or having a crazy high load time during a traffic surge.
If your website gets crashed during a traffic surge then you can lose a lot of money because your site won't load or will have a very high loading time which will send customers away from your site. That's why it's best to load test your website using this online tool before launching it. So, that you can prepare for a traffic surge in your website to avoid it getting crashed.		
			Website load test online using Loader.io -
		
		To do a website load test online we will use this online Application load testing Tool called Loader.io. 
1. First go to the site and here you will need to make a new account. Click on “Sign Up Now” and then select the Plan you need. Click on Sign Up Now again below the plan you want to use.2. Now here you will need to give your company name or any name you want and after that add your email and a secure password. And after that click on “Sign Up”.

		6. Now here you will need to add your domain name. Add your domain name and then click on the “Verify” button to continue.
																														
		7. To verify that you own that website you will have to copy the verification token that they give you and then add it to your website.		
																														
		8. Copy the verification code and open a new notepad file. Paste the verification code in the txt file and then save the file with the name as the verification code. Like “loaderio-753f78a8b2f4d1051db444f419f24e29.txt”.		
																														
		9. Now using FTP or File Manager in WordPress upload the txt file to your website’s root directory.

Now here you will be able to see all the things you need to see how well your site is performing. Most important is the “Response time” because a high response time means your site is not able to handle that load properly. 		
																														
		If you see a spike in the response time in the graph below. Then it means that your server is having a hard time processing the requests. Also in Response Counts, if you see any timeout then it means that the server failed to process a request.You can test out different settings in Loader.io to see how your website performs during a traffic surge which will help you prepare for a traffic surge in the future.
And that is how you can do a website load test online using Loader.io in a few easy steps.		
			Frequently asked questions -
		
			Does doing a website load test can break my site?		
		No, doing a website load test won't break your website. But what it can do is crash your website's server for a few minutes meaning that you won't be able to access your website for a few minutes.This will get fixed automatically after you stop the load testing. And after that, you will be able to access your website without any problem.
			Does my web hosting provider allow load testing?
		
		Now load testing a website is something that not all hosting providers allow you to do. Because if you are using any shared hosting then you can cause problems for other users on the same server as you will use up all the resources of that server.That's why it's important to contact your hosting provider before doing a website load test otherwise your web hosting account might get banned for abuse.One more thing you should know is that doing a website load test uses a lot of resources from a server which means that if you are hosting your website on a limited resources hosting plan then you might have to pay some extra money to keep your site running. 
Because otherwise, they will just lower the resources provided to your website and make it go down.This is not a problem in VPS hosting as you get a server with dedicated resources and not shared resources.
