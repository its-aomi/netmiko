				"articleBody": "Today I'll show you how you can install, set up &amp; Use the Microsoft IndexNow plugin on your WordPress website.

The IndexNow plugin by Microsoft is a new protocol created to help webmasters to submit their website URLs to search engines that are using the INdexNow protocol. This plugin will help in notifying the search engines when there's any change in your website.

It will automatically notify the search engines of new posts, or deleted or updated posts. This will help in maintaining the SEO of your website or blog as the search engine will crawl, index your website better.
Install &amp; Activate IndexNow Plugin
You can install the Microsoft IndexNow plugin using two methods, you can either download it directly from the wordpress.org website or you can search it within your WordPress admin dashboard.

If you want to download it directly from the official website, here is the link for that - https://wordpress.org/plugins/indexnow/.&nbsp;

Just go to the link above and click on the download button, this will download an indexnow.zip file to your downloads folder. Once the download finishes go log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.



After logging in to the admin dashboard, go to plugins &gt; Add New, here at the top click on “Upload Plugins” then choose the file.

Select the downloaded indexnow zip file from your computer and click on Install Now. This might take a few seconds to complete, after it finishes installing click on Activate Plugin to activate the IndexNow plugin.



Now, if you don't want to go through all of the steps above then you can install the IndexNow plugin by just logging in to your admin dashboard.

Here go to Plugins &gt; Add New. In the search bar search for “IndexNow”, here now install the IndexNow Plugin by Microsoft. Once installed click on activate to activate the plugin.



The settings of the IndexNow plugin can be found in the left admin menu. Here just click on the IndexNow option.
Setup IndexNow Plugin
After installing and activating the plugin you will have to now set up the plugin to be able to use it.

If you click on the IndexNow plugin option from the admin menu the first time, then you will see the setup screen of the plugin. First, you will need to click on the “Let’s get Started” button.



Now you will be in the plugin dashboard, here if you want then you can keep the default setting of auto submission of blog posts when they update, publish, or get deleted. Or you can make it manual so that it will not automatically submit the URLs to the search engines.

If you want to change the submission of URLs in the IndexNow plugin from automatic to Manual then just click on the three dots at the “Automate URL submission” section and click on “Edit Preference”.



The Edit preference for Automate URL Submission will be enabled by default, all you will need to do is choose the Disable option and click on Save. Now your website URLs won't get submitted to search engines automatically.
How to use IndexNow Plugin
Using the IndexNow plugin is fairly easy, after installing and setting up the plugin you can let it automatically submit the URLs of your website when they update or get deleted or you can make it manual.

To manually submit a URL to the IndexNow plugin, first copy the URL of the post or page that you want to submit to the search engines.

After that go to the IndexNow plugin dashboard from the admin menu. Here in the Manual URL Submissions section, click on the submit URL option. Enter your URL and click on Submit URL to submit the URL to the search engines.



You can see the status of the URL whether it was submitted successfully or not below in the URLs submitted section.
When will the Submitted URL in IndexNow Plugin get Indexed?
Now after submitting the Url of your website's page or post to the IndexNow plugin you might be wondering when it will get indexed.

For your page or post to get indexed in the different search engines, your post or page must follow the different guidelines of the search engines. The IndexNow plugin only notifies the search engine that the submitted URL exists on the web so that the search engines can try to index it.

Submitting the Url to the IndexNow plugin doesn't mean that it will get Indexed. It only works as a tool to notify search engines about your URLs.
How to Uninstall IndexNow plugin Completely
If you don't want to use the IndexNow plugin anymore and want to get rid of all the data of the plugin then you can just deactivate and delete the plugin.

Deleting the IndexNow plugin will remove all the data associated with the plugin from your WordPress website.

That's it, that is how you can install, set up and use the IndexNow plugin By Microsoft to submit the Urls of your website for Indexing to different search engines like bing, yandex, google etc.

				"@type": "BlogPosting",
				"name": "How to Install Koha Library Software on Windows 10",
				"url": "https://netmiko.com/install-koha-library-software-windows/",
				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can install Koha library Software on your Windows 10 operating system. Koha is an open-source integrated library system for libraries to keep track and store data. It is used in libraries of schools and universities for library management.
In this tutorial you will see the full installation process of koha library software on your windows computer, so make sure to read the article fully line by line to avoid getting into any problem while installing koha.		
			Installing Koha Library Software on Windows 		
		Okay, so the Koha Library Software is only available for the Linux operating system, which means that if you go to the official website of Koha then you will see that there are only download options for Linux and not windows.For Linux - Koha Installation Tutorial for Ubuntu 20.04Now to fix that problem there is a Modified version of Koha which is modified to be able to run on your windows operating system. This makes it easier for people to run and install Koha on their windows operating system as not a lot of people know how to use Linux.		
			Download Koha for Windows		
		To be able to install Koha Library Software you will need to first download it, to download the Windows version of Koha first click on this link here -		
			
						Click here
					
		
		That link will open Mediafire, from where you can download the Windows version of Koha, to download just click on “DOWNLOAD”, the file size will be 592Mb so make sure that you have a stable internet connection.		
																														
		Wait for the download to finish. 		
			Move & Unzip Koha
		
		After the download finishes, open your file manager and go to the downloads directory, here look for the Koha_for_Windows.zip file, select the file and right-click it, click on “CUT”.		
																														
		
Now go to the root directory of your Windows PC and paste the Koha zip file there. You can paste it in any root directory like C:, D:, E:.		
																														
		In my case, I have moved the downloaded Koha zip file to the E: drive. So now after moving it, you will need to unzip the zip file. To do that select the Koha_for_Windows.zip and right-click it, click on “Extract Here”.This will extract all the contents of the zip file in your drive, this will take a little bit of time to finish extracting. After the extraction finishes the extracted folder that you will get will be named “usr”. 		
																														
			Running Koha Library Software 
		
		After extracting the zip file you will get an extracted folder named “usr”, now first make sure that the usr folder is directly in the root directory and not inside any folder, it should directly be in the root like “E:usr” and not “E:folderusr”.
Now to run Koha in your Windows operating system just go inside the “usr” folder, here scroll down and look for the “StartMysqlServer.bat '' file, double click on the bat file to run it.		
																														
		After double-clicking the StartMySqlserver.bat file, the terminal of your windows computer will run the file for a second and automatically stop and close the terminal.After running the first bat file, you will need to run the second bat file which will be named “StartServer.bat”, again double click it and let it run in the terminal, now to be able to use koha you will need to keep the bat file running in the terminal, so minimize the terminal tab.Finally, run the third bat file which is named “ZebraServer.bat”. Again keep the terminal window running, so minimize the window.		
			Access Koha Dashboard
		
		After running all the three bat files, you can now access the Koha Library Software dashboard by going to your localhost. 
In your browser just enter http://localhost:8080, this will redirect you to the login page of Koha Library, the default username and password for logging into Koha Windows version is “admin”. You can now start using Koha on your Windows computer. The version of koha that is provided here is Version 3.16.01.  		
			Access Koha WEB OPAC 
		
		To access the Web OPAC of Koha Library Software on windows you will need to go to http://localhost on your browser.		
			Stopping Koha		
		Once you are done and have finished your work, you can now stop Koha from running by first closing all the terminal windows that were running.After closing all the running terminal windows, go to your file manager and go inside the usr folder of Koha, here look for “StopMysqlServer.bat”, double click the bat file, and let it run, it will stop the Localhost server from running automatically.
That's it, Koha will be now completely stopped. To run Koha again on your windows just run the three bat files in the usr folder.		
			Uninstalling Koha from Windows
		
		To completely uninstall the Koha Windows version you will need to just delete the Koha usr folder from your computer. That’s it, that is how you can Install Koha Library Software on your windows operating system. If you have any questions or if you are facing any problem while installing koha, then comment below. Thank you.		
			FAQ - 		
			Is the Koha Library Windows version safe to use?
		
		The windows version of koha is safe, but I think it will be better if you could install the official version of koha on a Linux Machine Because in the Windows version of Koha you will not get a lot of security, and also you will not get any updates.It's better to just call a computer guy and install Linux on your computer. After that, you can follow this tutorial here - Install Koha Library Software on Ubuntu 20.04.",

				"url": "https://netmiko.com/install-xapk-android-no-pc/",
				"articleBody": "Today I will show you how you can install an XAPK file on your Android device without the need for a computer or PC. If you are downloading any app or game from the internet then chances are that the file that you are downloading is a xapk instead of the regular apk file, now the problem with this file type is that you cannot install xapk directly like you can install an apk.
To know why you will need to first know what a xapk is and how it is different from the regular apk.		
			What is XAPK 
		
		XAPK is a new file type that contains all the files of an app or game, files like images, scripts, fonts, and the apk of the app or game are all stored in a single file extension called XAPK. This is very helpful for people that want to install apps and games from third-party websites and app stores.Previously, before the introduction of XAPK, people used to download both the apk and OBB files (data files) separately which was not very convenient, due to which XAPK was introduced by using which we can install an app or game completely with just one file.		
			What is the difference between APK and XAPK
		
		The only difference between an APK &amp; XAPK is that an APK can be installed on your android phone directly without the need for an external app or without going through extra steps to install it.
			Installing a XAPK on Android		
		Okay, so now let's see how we can install an XAPK on our Android phone without the use of a PC. I will show you multiple methods to do this, the first one will be a direct install method and the other ones will be using apps.		
			Using File Manager 		
		To install an XAPK using a File manager you will need to first install zarchiver, which is a file manager app for android. You can download zarchiver from the play store by going to this link here - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver, It's around 3Mb in size, install it and open it.If you are opening zarchiver for the first time, then you might get asked to allow storage permissions, allow it to continue. Inside zarchiver go to the folder where you have the xapk file downloaded.
For most people, the downloaded files from the internet will be stored in the Download folder. Locate the xapk file and long press on it. This will bring up a menu from the bottom, click on “Rename”, now rename the xapk files extension from “.xapk” to “.zip”. Once done save it.		
																														
		Now click on the saved zip file, click on view. Now look for the OBB file, the OBB file will be named like “com.something.something”, long-press the OBB file and click on “Copy”.[ If there are multiple OBB files or you cannot find the obb file then use the other methods shown in this blog post ]On the top of the app click on your file path, after that click on Device Memory then go to Android, then OBB, and paste the OBB file there by clicking the clipboard icon at the bottom of the zarchiver app.		
																														
		
After pasting the obb file, go back to the zip file and click on the .apk file, click on Install to install the xapk file on your android using zarchiver.		
			Using Apkpure App 		
		Now if the file manager method didn't work for you or it was too complicated then you can follow this method instead to install a xapk on your android.To begin, first, install the official apkpure app that you can search for on Google or you can use this link here - https://m.apkpure.com/apkpure-app.html, Download the latest version of Apkpure and install it.After downloading and installing apkpure, open it. Allow all the permissions it asks for, like storage and phone. After that in the apkpure app, click on “ME” at the bottom right corner, after that click on “App Management”.		
																														
		Now in the App Management tab go to APK/XAPK MANAGEMENT, here you will see all the xapks and apks downloaded on your device, click on install.
Your phone will now ask for permissions to install from unknown sources, allow it, and go back to continue. If the app brings you back to the home screen then just go to apk/xapk management again and install the xapk that you want to install.That is how you can install a xapk on your android device using the apkpure app.		
			Using Apk Installer by Uptodown 
		
		If Apkpure didn't work for you then you can use the Apk Installer by Uptodown, you can download the uptodown apk installer from google play store by simply searching for “Apk Installer by Uptodown” or you can just download it from its website at - https://uptodown-apk-installer.en.uptodown.com/android. Install the app and open it, it will ask for file and storage permissions, allow it to continue. On the home screen click on Install Apps.
Now here you will see all the xapks and apks downloaded on your android phone, look for the xapk that you want to download and click on it. This will now take a few minutes to finish and your xapk will be installed.		
			Using XAPK Installer 
		
		Now, as the name says, it is an app that is made for installing xapk files on your android. You can download XAPK Installer from the play store by searching for “XAPK Installer”, the developer is MTV Mobile.Download and install the app and open it, in the home screen of the app you will need to first provide the app two permissions to work, the first will be Install Packages and the second will be Read and Write permissions. Click on both of them and allow the app the permissions.After providing the necessary permissions to the app, click on the Install XAPK button and select the “Automatically search for XAPK” option.
Once the search finishes, all the xapk files stored in your device will show up here, click on the download icon next to it to install the xapk on your android.And that is how you can install a xapk file using the xapk installer on android.		
			What is the Recommended Method to install a XAPK?
		
		The method that I recommend you to use to install a xapk on your android device is using the apkpure app. Using Apkpure installer is easy and has fewer chances of error compared to other apps like uptodown installer and XAPK Installer.		
			Best Apps to Install XAPK 
		
		
Okay so if you are looking for the best apps to install xapk files on your android device then here are the best apps for installing xapk - Apkpure AppUptodown Apk InstallerXAPK InstallerApk Installer proApp Bundle InstallerIf you want the list for more apps then comment below.		
			Fix XAPK not Working after Installing
		
		Okay, so if you installed an apk manually using the file manager and now the app is not working, then here are the reasons and fixes for it -
Wrong Destination - When copying the data files on the xapk to its location you might have pasted the data files in the wrong path. You can fix this by uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again with the correct path.App opened before full install - You might have opened the installed app before copying the data files to the obb folder. Always install the app last, first copy the data files to their location then install the apk file that is inside the xapk.If you made one of these mistakes then chances are that your installed app or game will not work, reinstall the app again properly to fix it. Thank you.",

				"url": "https://netmiko.com/install-wordpress-nginx-with-varnish-ubuntu/",
				"articleBody": "Today I'll show you how you can host a WordPress website on an NGINX server with varnish caching for a fast and optimized WordPress website. If you want to host a WordPress website that can handle lots of traffic without crashing on a cheap cloud hosting like digital ocean basic plan then this is the perfect tutorial for you, with the help of this tutorial your WordPress website will be able to handle 5000+ visitors daily at a cost of just 5$ per month.
			Why NGINX instead of Apache?
		
		The reason I recommended you to use Nginx instead of Apache for your WordPress site’s web server is that Nginx can handle more traffic and load compared to an Apache server, as Apache server uses more memory compared to Nginx because it creates a new thread for each request which consumes memory.		
			Creating a Ubuntu Server 		
		Okay so this step is for those people who haven't created an ubuntu server yet, I will show you how you can create a ubuntu 20.04 server on AWS and also on Digital Ocean. Skip this part if you already have a ubuntu server.		
			Amazon AWS
		
		To create a new Ubuntu server or Instance on AWS you will need to first log in to your AWS account, here go to the EC2 dashboard and click on “Launch Instance” to start the process of creating a new Ubuntu instance.
First, you will need to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), in the search bar search for Ubuntu, this will display a few ubuntu machine images, you will need to select the “Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM)” which comes under free tier, click on select on the right side.		
																														
		After that you will need to choose an instance type, choose the instance that suits your need, like t2.micro or t.2small for a small and medium blog, choose the instance type that you can afford, and click on next.In the Configure Instance Details, you don't need to change anything, click on next to continue. In the Storage Tab enter the amount of storage that you need and the storage type that you need, like SSD or Magnetic, once done click on next. In Tags, no need to do anything, click next again.
																														
		Now in the Configure Security Group tab, you will need to add two security group rules, which are HTTP and HTTPS. Click on “Add Rule”, in type select “HTTP”, again add another rule for “HTTPS”. Click Review and Launch to continue.		
																														
		In the Review Tab, check if everything is correct or not, things like Instance type, storage, and Machine image are important things to check before launching the instance. If everything is correct then click on “Launch”. It will now ask you to add a Key Pair to the instance, select create a new Key pair option from the dropdown, name the keypair and click on download to download a .pem or .ppk file. Save this file somewhere safe because you will need it to log in to your server.		
																														
		After downloading the Key pair, click on Launch to launch a ubuntu server.It will take a few minutes for the instance to run so wait a few minutes. Once done you can proceed to log in to the server.
			Digital Ocean
		
		If you are using Digital ocean then here are the steps to create a ubuntu server or droplet. To begin, log in to your digital ocean dashboard.Click on Create then select Droplets, to create a new droplet. In image Choose Ubuntu 20.04, after that in plans select the plan that suits your need.		
																														
		Scroll down and in the data center region select the server that is closest to your customers or users. After that in the Additional option check the “IpV6” and “Monitoring”.		
																														
		Now in authentication select Password and enter a very secure password, make sure to note it down somewhere safe. Scroll down and in Hostname enter your domain name and scroll down again and click on Create Droplet.
This will create a new ubuntu server for you.		
			Connect Domain -
		
		If you want to connect a domain name to your server then you can follow these steps otherwise you can skip this step if you just want to use the IP address.Login to your domain provider and select your domain name and go to its DNS settings.Add a new “A” Record, in the name field enter “@” and in value enter the IP address of your server.After that add a “CNAME” Record, in the name enter “www” and in value enter your domain name.		
																														
		Wait for the DNS propagation to finish and your domain will be connected.		
			Install Putty 
		
		Now to login to the ubuntu server, we will need to install Putty, you can download putty from its official website at - https://www.putty.org/. Download the latest version of putty from the website and install it.
			Login to Ubuntu Server 
		
		Once you have created the ubuntu server and installed putty, you can now log in to your server. This process is different for different cloud hostings, I will show you the steps for AWS and Digital Ocean. You can google how to log in to your cloud server if you are using something else.		
			Amazon AWS -
		
		If you want to log in to your ubuntu server hosted on AWS then here are the steps. Open putty, in the hostname, enter the IP address of your amazon instance, after that on the left side click on “SSH” twice, this will display some more options, click on “Auth”, after that click on Browse and select the .ppk or .pem Key Pair downloaded during instance launch.		
																														
		
After that in putty click on open to connect to your AWS instance. In the terminal, it will ask “Login as”, enter root and you will be logged in to your AWS ubuntu server.		
			Digital Ocean -
		
		If you are using digital ocean then just copy the Ip address of the Droplet and open putty, in hostname enter the Ip address and click on open.Login as Root, enter the password that you used when setting up the digital ocean droplet. That's it you will be now logged into your ubuntu server.		
			Install NGINX 
		
		Okay now it's time to set up the server, we will be installing WordPress on Lemp Stack so the first thing we will need to do is install NGINX. All you need to do is copy &amp; paste the commands given below in the putty terminal.
First, update your ubuntu apt packages before starting the installation process, you can update your apt packages using this command - 		
			sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
		
		After that you can now download Nginx, to do that use this command - 		
			sudo apt-get install nginx		
		Once Nginx is installed check its status using the command “sudo service nginx status”, if it shows an output that says “Active(running) then Nginx is installed and running properly. Exit the status screen by pressing “q”.After this, you will need to set up a firewall for ubuntu and also add a rule for ufw.		
			sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
		
		After adding the rule enable the ufw firewall and also check its status.
			sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status		
		Once done you can now check if Nginx is working properly or not, to do that enter the IP address of your Ubuntu server in a browser. This will display the “Welcome to Nginx” page which means that Nginx is working perfectly.		
																														
			Install MySQL 		
		Now we will install the MySQL database, again before starting the installation make sure to update the apt packages again - 		
			sudo apt-get update		
		After that enter the MySQL installation command, you might need to press “y” after entering the command.		
			sudo apt-get install mysql-server
		
		After MySQL finishes installing, check its status and exit status screen once done. You can exit status by pressing “q”.
			sudo service mysql status		
		After this, you will need to now create a root password for your MySQL, and remove anonymous users, Disable remote root login, remove the test database and reload privilege tables.First create a root password, to do that first enter the command given below - 		
			sudo mysql_secure_installation
		
		In the terminal you will now get an output asking “Would you like to set up the VALIDATE PASSWORD component?”, just enter any key to continue. After that, you will be asked to enter a new password and confirm the password.Create a strong password and confirm it.After that you will be asked to remove the anonymous users, press y to continue. After that it will ask “Disallow remote root login”, press y to continue.
After that, in both remove test databases and reload privilege tables press and enter “y” to finish setting up the MySQL database.		
			Install PHP		
		Now we will install PHP for our Nginx server, to begin first you will need to add the universe repository of Ubuntu to your system, use the command given below for adding the universe repo.		
			sudo add-apt-repository universe		
		After adding the repo, update the apt packages and install php-fpm and php-mysql. You can install them by using these commands - 		
			sudo apt-get install php-fpm
sudo apt-get install php-mysql
		
		After installing both php-fpm and php-mysql you will need to configure Nginx for installing WordPress in it.
			Configure NGINX 
		
		To configure Nginx for php you will need to first edit the default config file of your Nginx server, to do that we will be using nano editor, you can also use vim editor for this, enter this command in terminal -		
			sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
		
		The file path for the server block can be different sometimes.That command will open the default config file in the nano editor, you will now need to change a few things inside this file to set up the Nginx server. The first thing will be to add index.php.Inside this file scroll down and look for the “Add index.php to the list” option, here between the index and index.html enter index.php. Just below that in “server_name” enter your domain name or IP address. 
																														
		After that remove the “try_files $uri $uri/ =404;” line below it and replace it with the line given below.		
			try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
		
		Once done, just below it you will need to uncomment 3 lines of code, you can uncomment them by removing the “#”, the lines that you will need to uncomment are - location ~ .php$ {include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;After that, also uncomment the closing bracket below the “fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;” line. Once done, recheck everything and save the file by clicking “CTRL+X &gt; Y &gt; Enter”.
																														
		After saving the file, check if there are any errors in the file by using the command -		
			sudo nginx -t
		
		This will display an output in the terminal like, “Syntax is OK” and “test is successful”, this means that there are no errors after editing the file and you can now proceed to the next step.First, reload your Nginx config using the command - 		
			sudo service nginx reload
		
		You can check if php on your Nginx server is working or not by creating a new .php file at location “/var/www/html/” by using the command - 		
			sudo nano /var/www/html/test.php
		
		
			Install phpMyAdmin		
		Now to be able to set up and manage MySQL databases on your WordPress website you will need to install and set up phpMyAdmin.To begin first update your apt packages using the command “sudo apt update”, after that download PHPMyAdmin using the command - 		
			sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
		
		During the download, it will ask you to enter “y” enter y and press enter to continue, when asked to choose a web server you will need to press TAB Key and press enter to continue.		
																														
		After that select yes and press enter in “Configure database for phpmyadmin”, The setup will now ask you for a password for PHPMyAdmin, enter the same password that you used during MySQL installation, select OK and press Enter, you might get asked to confirm the password.
Once phpMyAdmin is installed you will need to link your PHPMyAdmin to your root directory, to do that enter the command given below.		
			sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html/phpmyadmin
		
		Once done go to your web browser and go to domain.com/phpmyadmin or ip_addresss/phpmyadmin to check if PHPMyAdmin is working perfectly or not. If it is then now you will need to create a superuser to log in to your admin dashboard.First, enter the command given below to enter MySQL.		
			sudo mysql -u root -p
		
		After this you will now need to create a username and password for phpmyadmin, the format for the command will be “CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';”, where change the username to anything you like and change the password to a secure password.
			CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
		
		After that, grant all the root privileges to the user using the command below, change the username to the one you added using the above command -		
			GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
		
		Once done, exit using the command “exit”.[ OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED STEP ]You should secure your phpMyAdmin by following this tutorial here - https://bit.ly/3FG2lso		
			Create a MySQL Database 
		
		Now after installing phpmyadmin, log in to the dashboard by going to your_domain.com/phpmyadmin, log in using the username and password that you provided.
After logging in, on the top left click on “Databases”, here in “database name” enter a database name like “wordpress_database” and click on create to create the database. After that proceed to the installation of WordPress.		
																														
			Install WordPress 
		
		Now we can start the installation of WordPress, first, go to the official website of WordPress at - https://wordpress.org and download the latest version of the WordPress zip file.Once done extract the downloaded zip file and go inside it, here look for “wp-config-sample.php”, right click and rename it to just “wp-config.php”, after renaming it, edit the PHP file using a note editor by right clicking and open with &gt; note pad. 		
																														
		
		Inside the wp-config file look for “MySQL database username” and change the “database_name_here” to your database name. Below that change the “username_here” to your MySQL username, below that change password to your database password.		
																														
		Once done, save the file. After that select all the files using your mouse and archive them to a zip file named wordpress.zip.		
																														
		Now, open Filezilla and log in using the Ip address of your server, username will be root, enter the password of your server, and select port 22. For AWS you will need to use the key pair to log in to Filezilla, the steps can be seen here - https://youtu.be/-80-39VNzOA. After logging in, go to the file path “/var/www/html”, and inside the html, directory upload the edited wordpress.zip that you created. Wait for the upload to finish, after the wordpress.zip finishes uploading open putty and log in to your server.
																														
		First, you will need to install unzip, to do that update your apt packages and install unzip - 		
			sudo apt-get install zip unzip 
		
		After installing unzip, you can now unzip the WordPress zip file, to do that change your directory to “/var/www/html/” using the command - 		
			cd /var/www/html/
		
		After changing the directory use the unzip command to unzip the WordPress zip file -		
			unzip wordpress.zip
		
		Once the zip file finishes unzipping without any error, remove the zip file from the directory -
			rm wordpress.zip
		
		That's it, WordPress is now installed successfully on your Nginx server.		
			Setup WordPress		
		To set up WordPress just enter your Ip address in a browser, if you have a domain connected then enter your domain name.You will be redirected to the setup page of WordPress where you will need to first enter your site title, then enter a username for logging in to the server and a secure password, after that enter the admin email and Click “Install WordPress”.Once WordPress install finishes you can log in to your website by going to “domain_or_IP/wp-login.php”.In your WordPress website, check if everything is working or not, things like are you able to install and activate themes and plugins or not, does changing permalinks break your website. Try out different things and keep refreshing your website for potential errors.
If there is none then congratulations, your WordPress website is now almost ready to use, why almost?? Because there are still two things that we have left to set up on our WordPress website, the first is an SSL Certificate and the second one is Varnish Cache for an optimized web server.		
			Install SSL Certificate 
		
		Okay so now you have two options to add an SSL Certificate to your WordPress website with an Nginx server, the first is directly installing a free SSL certificate in your web server, the second one is to use Cloudflare to add the SSL certificate.Both methods are easy to do, if you don't want to use Cloudflare then you can use the direct install method and if you are using Cloudflare then use Cloudflare to add the SSL.		
			Install SSL Nginx-Ubuntu
		
		To install SSL directly in our server we will use certbot, to begin first update your apt packages using the command “sudo apt-get update”, after that install the certbot using the command - 
			sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
		
		If you are getting any errors then try “sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx” instead. After installing the certbot, run the command given below to get an SSL Certificate for your domain or IP. 		
			sudo certbot --nginx
		
		At first, you will be asked for an email address, enter an email then press enter, after that accept the terms and conditions by pressing a, after that enter y to receive a newsletter from let's encrypt. After that, you will need to select the domain name or IP address that you want to get the SSL for.After that, you will be asked whether you want to redirect all the traffic from HTTP to HTTPS or not, enter 2 and press enter. Now your SSL certificate will be assigned to your domain or IP address and HTTP traffic will now get redirected to HTTPS.
NOTE: The SSL certificate that you will get will only be valid for 90days, which means you will need to renew it after 90days using putty again.		
			Install SSL using Cloudflare
		
		If you don't want to install an SSL directly on your server then you can use Cloudflare’s SSL to serve your website over HTTPS. To do that make a Cloudflare account and connect your domain name, after that log in to the dashboard and go to the SSL/TLS tab.Here Scroll down and select Flexible, after that go to Edge certificates and scroll down and enable the “Always use HTTPS” option.		
																														
		That's it, all the frontend users will now be served using a secure SSL certificate.
			Install Varnish Cache
		
		Now the final thing that we will need to install on our Nginx server is Varnish Cache. Varnish Cache is an HTTP accelerator used for caching HTTP requests to make a web server response time faster.To Install Varnish on your Nginx server, first update its apt package using the command “sudo apt-get update”, after that use this command to install varnish cache.		
			sudo apt-get install varnish -y
		
		After installing varnish check if it is installed or not by entering the command “varnish -v” in the terminal, this will show you the version of varnish installed.After that, you will need to change the port to which Varnish listens to. Enter the command given below which will again open the default configuration file of Nginx.
			sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default		
		Inside the file scroll down and look for “Virtual host Configuration”, change both the listen 80 to 8088. Once done save the file and restart the Nginx server.		
																														
			systemctl restart nginx
		
		Now you will need to edit the varnish.service file, to do that we will use nano editor, use the command - 		
			sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/varnish.service
		
		Inside the file change the default port 6081 to 80, save it, and after that reload daemon.		
			systemctl daemon-reload
		
		Now you will need to edit the default.vcl file, use the command - 
			sudo nano /etc/varnish/default.vcl
		
		Inside the vcl file in “backend default” change the port from “8080” to “8088”. Save and Exit.After that restart varnish - 		
			systemctl restart varnish
		
		Now check if varnish is working correctly or not by entering this command -		
			curl -I your-server-ip
		
		
		In the terminal, you will get the output which will show if varnish is working or not.That’s it, you have now successfully installed a WordPress website on an NGINX Server with Varnish Cache in Ubuntu 20.04. If you are facing any problems then comment below, thank you for reading. ",

				"articleBody": "Today I will walk you through the steps to host a WordPress Website on Alibaba Cloud for free. I will show you everything you need to do to get a new WordPress website set up on Alibaba cloud.The steps for hosting a WordPress website on Alibaba cloud are very easy, you just need a little bit of time and your website will be up and running.
			Why Host WordPress on Alibaba Cloud?
		
		Because it's free and fast!! You get a slice of 1 core CPU, 1Gb memory that you can increase later, and 40Gb of storage for the website files, that's more than enough for a new low traffic blog, or a moderate traffic blog. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars on web hosting you can host your website for free for 1year on Alibaba cloud, and once your website becomes successful you can move to another host or just stick to Alibaba cloud. Cloud is very cheap compared to other types of web hosting, you only pay for what you use.You can easily run a high-traffic blog that gets 2-3k visitors per day on Alibaba cloud for just 5$ a month.
			Register in Alibaba Cloud 		
		Okay, so now let's get started, to begin we will need to first create a free trial account on Alibaba cloud, to sign up for the free trial of Alibaba cloud, click on this link - https://www.alibabacloud.com/free, you can also search on google for “Alibaba free trial” in case the link changes.On the Alibaba free trial page click on the “Get started for Free” button, this will redirect you to the sign-in page, in the sign-in page click on the “Register Now” link at the bottom right.		
																														
		On the signup page, you will need to select “individual account” and click on next, after that you will need to enter your email address and create a very secure password that contains a capital letter, symbol, and number. Confirm the password and click on sign up.
																														
		On the next page, you will need to select your country and verify your phone number, you can verify using your phone number or your email address, whatever you feel comfortable with. I recommend you to verify using your phone number.Click on “Send Message” which will send you a verification code on your phone number or email, enter it in the signup page, agree to the agreement and click on Sign Up once again to create an Alibaba Cloud Account.		
																														
		After this your Alibaba cloud account will be created, now you will need to Enter some basic information about you, like name, address, postal code, and phone number. Select Individual Account at the top.Enter your phone number and click on verify, you will get a verification code at the phone number provided, enter it and verify your phone number again, after that click on submit.
Now in the Payment Information tab, you will need to provide your payment info, the payment method will be different for different countries, if it asks for a credit card then provide it there, don't worry you won't be charged a cent for it, payment info is asked to prevent spam accounts.After providing your payment info, you will automatically get redirected to the confirmation page of Alibaba cloud, click on “Free Trial” to start the activation process of the free trial of Alibaba Cloud.		
																														
			Create ECS Instance in Alibaba Cloud
		
		After clicking on Free Trial you will be redirected to the free trial page of Alibaba cloud, here scroll down a little and select the products that you want to use.If you just want to host a simple WordPress blog with low to medium traffic then just select the Burstable t5, 1 core CPU, 1Gb memory, 40Gb SSD storage which will give you a trial period of 12months, meaning that you host your low to medium traffic website free for 12 months.		
																														
		You can also use the Burstable t6/t5, 2 core CPU, 2Gb memory which is more powerful and can handle high traffic, but the problem with this is that the trial period will only be 3months for this, so better choose the 1 core CPU one with 12 months.
Just select it and click on “Try Now”, after which you will now need to set up the server aka ECS, you will need to first select the Data server region, select the server which is closest to your customers, in “operating system” select “WordPress on LAMP Ubuntu 16”.		
																														
		If you want you can also select a different operating system like Ubuntu 18.04, but remember that you will set up WordPress manually using the terminal if you do that, I recommend you to just use the WordPress LAMP which automatically does everything for us.After selecting your data center and operating system, accept the Terms and conditions and click on Try now. This will automatically set up a WordPress ECS instance for you.
If you get any error like “Sorry you have already tried the instance” or something then don't worry and go to your Alibaba Cloud Console from the top-right menu, then go to Elastic Compute Service (ECS) from the top left corner menu, then go to “Instances”.There you will see your WordPress instance.		
																														
			Change Disk Image
		
		Now after creating an ECS instance you will need to change the disk image of your instance. To do that first go to your console&gt;Elastic compute service&gt;Instances. Here select your instance and click on STOP at the bottom.Select Force stop, and also check the “Proceed to forcibly stop” option and click on OK, this will stop the instance, this might take a few minutes, keep refreshing the page until the status says “Stopped”.
Once the instance stops, select the instance once again, and below click on the More button, after that select Disk &amp; Image &gt; Replace System Disk. Click on OK on the popup.		
																														
		After that, you will be in the operating system settings where to change the disk image of your instance you will need to click on MarketPlace Image then “Select from Image Market”.That will open up the Marketplace, In the search bar you will need to search for “WordPress”, which will bring up a lot of different options, the WordPress image that you will need to select is the “WordPress on LEMP CentOS7.2 64 bits powered by IGS”. Click on USE to continue.		
																														
		After that scroll down and in Security settings, click on Password and enter a secure password, confirm it, and accept the Terms of service below. Click on Create Order to continue the payment, it's free so no need to pay anything, just finish the purchase and once the purchase completes, go back to your console.
			Configure Security Groups 
		
		Now the last thing to do before we can access our WordPress website is to configure security groups. To configure Security groups go to your console and then go to “Network &amp; Security” by clicking on the top left menu, after that in Network &amp; Security go to “Security groups”.Here click on “Add rules” on the right side of your Instance, Click on “Quick rule Creation” to add a new rule.In Common Port (TCP) check “http”, in Custom Port range enter “21/22”, in Authorization Object enter “0.0.0.0/0” and click on OK to add that rule.		
																														
		Again click on Quick rule creation and add another rule, this time in Common Port check “https” in Custom Port enter “31/32” and in Authorization Object enter “0.0.0.0/0”, click on OK to add that rule, once done go back to Instances.		
																														
		Now here in Instances check if the status of your WordPress Instance is Running or not, if it's not running then select the instance and click on start to start it. 
Doesn't matter if the instance was running or not, you will have to restart the instance to proceed, select the instance and click on restart. Once done you can now proceed to set up the WordPress website.		
			Setup WordPress
		
		To set up your WordPress site hosted on Alibaba cloud free tier you will need to copy the Internet IP address of the Instance. Copy it and paste it into a web browser.You will need to configure your WordPress installation, select your language, and click on continue. Give your website name, username, a secure password, your email, make sure to remember the password and username because you will need it to log in to your WordPress website.Once done click on Install WordPress, after the installation finishes click on Log In and log in to your WordPress website using the provided username and password.
			Add a Custom Domain
		
		Okay so, now let's see how we can connect a custom domain like yourdomain.com instead of the IP Address of the Server. Because an IP address is not easy to remember and also not professional for a WordPress blog.You can add a custom domain to your WordPress website hosted on Alibaba cloud using two methods, the first is directly from your domain registrar and the second one is by using Cloudflare (which is recommended).		
			By using your domain registrar
		
		To add a custom domain to your Alibaba cloud-hosted website you will need to first log in to your domain registrar dashboard from where you bought your domain name. Hereafter logging in, select your domain name and go to its DNS settings.
In DNS settings you will need to add a new “A” record, the name field will be “@” and the value will be the IP Address of your Alibaba cloud instance. After that add another record which will be a CNAME.		
																														
		The name field will be “www” and the value will be your domain name. After adding both these values you will need to wait a few minutes to a few hours depending upon how fast the DNS propagates, once it does then you can access your website through the domain name instead of its IP address.		
			By Using Cloudflare 		
		If you have Cloudflare connected to your domain then you can use Cloudflare to add a custom domain to your WordPress website hosted on Alibaba Cloud. If you don't have Cloudflare connected to your domain then here are the steps to add Cloudflare - Create an account at https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up, add your domain name and complete the rest of the steps.Add Cloudflare nameservers to your DNS Settings by going to your domain provider, select your domain name and go to its Nameservers settings, remove the default nameservers and add the ones given by Cloudflare.Wait for the DNS Propagation to finish.
Okay so once Cloudflare is connected to your domain, go to the DNS settings in your Cloudflare dashboard, here add an A record with the name “@” and value the IP address of your Alibaba cloud instance.After that add a CNAME with the name “www” and value your domain name, that's it your website will be now connected to a custom domain. The plus point of using Cloudflare is that it gives you free CDN and DDOS protection and also hides the real IP address of your website.		
			Add SSL to Alibaba Cloud Hosted Website
		
		To add an SSL certificate to your Alibaba cloud-hosted WordPress website you can use Cloudflare that provides you with free SSL. To enable the SSL certificate login to your Cloudflare dashboard.
In the dashboard of Cloudflare go to SSL/TLS tab and make the SSL setting to “Flexible” this will serve your website with HTTPS to the users, after that you will need to redirect all the users using HTTP to HTTPS.		
																														
		To redirect everyone using HTTP to HTTPS you will need to go to SSL/TLS tab and then go to the Edge Certificates tab, here scroll down and find Always Use HTTPS, enable it and all your users using HTTP will now get redirected to HTTPS.		
			Fix WordPress Asking for FTP details Alibaba Cloud 
		
		After installing WordPress on Alibaba cloud if you are trying to install a plugin or a theme and WordPress asks for your FTP username and password then here's how you can fix it.		
			Using Plugin - 
		
		First, log in to your WordPress admin and go plugins, click on Add New and search for “File Manager” click on install, this will ask you for your FTP details, you can get it by logging in to your Alibaba Cloud Console.
Go to your instances and copy your IP address, go back to your WordPress dashboard, and in the FTP hostname enter “sftp://your_ip_address” or “your_ip_address”, in username enter “root” and in the password enter the password that you gave when changing disk image.After that click on proceed and install the plugin, once the plugin is installed open it, in the file manager look for “wp-config.php”, right-click on it, and select edit. After that enter the PHP codes from below in the wp-config file below “define (‘DB COLLATE’)”.		
			define(&ldquo;FTP_HOST&rdquo;, 'ftp.yourhost.com');
define(&ldquo;FTP_USER&rdquo;, 'root');                                          
define(&ldquo;FTP_PASS&rdquo;, 'password');
define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');
define('FTP_BASE', '/data/wwwroot/default/');
define('FTP_CONTENT_DIR', '/data/wwwroot/default/wp-content/');
define('FTP_PLUGIN_DIR ', '/data/wwwroot/default/wp-content/plugins/');
		
		Here, ftp.yourhost.com will be “sftp://your_instance_ip_address”, username and password would be the one from the disk image change step. Add all these to the wp-config file and save it.Go back to your Alibaba Cloud instance and restart it to see changes, also refresh your website.
			Using FileZilla -
		
		To fix the problem using FileZilla you will need to first connect to your FTP server using Filezilla, in hostname enter the IP address of your Alibaba cloud instance, in username enter root, and in password enter the password set during disk image change. Click Connect.After connecting to the server, go to the file path at - /data/wwwroot/defaultInside this file path, you will need to find wp-config, download it, and using note editor add the codes given above in the article. Save it and upload it back to the server.Restart the Alibaba Cloud instance to save the changes.
			Change WordPress URL & Site Address		
		One final thing left to do is to change the WordPress Address and Site Address, as the default URL will be the IP address instead of your domain name.To change your url go to your wordpress admin and then go to settings &gt; General. Here remove the IP Address and enter your domain name.		
																														
			PHP version Not Supported
		
		Okay so this is something that you might face if you install WordPress on Alibaba cloud, you will be unable to install some plugins due to an unsupported version of PHP. To fix this problem you will need to update the PHP of your server.You can see this tutorial on how you can update PHP - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-update-nginx-php. 
You can connect to your Alibaba cloud instance by ssh or by using putty.That's it, that is how you can host a WordPress website on Alibaba cloud for free, the free trial of Alibaba cloud will last for 12 months, so enjoy your free WordPress hosting for one year. Thank you for reading.		
			FAQ - 		
			How much traffic does a WordPress Website hosted on Alibaba Cloud Free tier Handle?		
		A WordPress website that is hosted on Alibaba Cloud free trial can handle at least 1500 to 3000 users per day with proper caching and optimization. If you use a CDN for both images and static resources then the website can easily handle more than 3000+ visitors per day.",
